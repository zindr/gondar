	<P><B>Granada  <small>(2015-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The Alhambra will be the primary reason for a visit, but the city is nice too and tapas are included with a drink.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ronda <small>(2015-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The small city of Ronda provides a fine break in between the nearby cities with its beautiful surroundings.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sevilla <small>(2015-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The major city in Andalucia is really worth a visit, known for its cathedral and boasting many tapas bars.</P>
