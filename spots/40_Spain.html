<P><B>Madrid  <small>(2008-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another very nice city, with beautiful museums and nice atmosphere.</P>

 <P><B>Barcelona  <small>(2008-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>I love Barcelona, it has it all with the Ramblas, beach, Gaudi architecture, nice food, ...</P>

 <P><B>Oviedo  <small>(2008-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>5 days for a congress, it was nice to have a different perspective on Spanish cities.</P>

 <P><B>Granada   <small>(2015-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>There are two things to mention, the Al Hambra which is interesting and the tapas that are like small free meals.</P>

 <P><B>Ronda  <small>(2015-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small city life in Andalusia with a natural back-drop and a slice of history, quite alright for a brief visit.</P>

 <P><B>Sevilla  <small>(2015-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe everyone likes Sevilla, and lucky us we were there during the Spanish festivities and beautiful winter sun.</P>

 <P><B>San Sebastian  <small>(2024-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe because I like the vibe better in Spain compared to France, this was a perfect place to spent a day city dwelling.</P>

 <P><B>Hondarribia  <small>(2024-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Surprisingly nice stop on the way back to France, this medieval city in the bay.</P>
