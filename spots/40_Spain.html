	<P><B>Madrid <small>(2008-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another very nice city, with beautiful museums and nice atmosphere.</P>
	
	<P><B>Barcelona <small>(2008-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I love Barcelona, it has it all with the Ramblas, beach, Gaudi architecture, nice food, ...</P>
	
	<P><B>Oviedo <small>(2008-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>5 days for a congress, it was nice to have a different perspective on Spanish cities.</P>
	
	<P><B>Granada  <small>(2015-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>There are two things to mention, the Al Hambra which is interesting and the tapas that are like small free meals.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ronda <small>(2015-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Small city life in Andalusia with a natural back-drop and a slice of history, quite alright for a brief visit.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sevilla <small>(2015-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Maybe everyone likes Sevilla, and lucky us we were there during the Spanish festivities and beautiful winter sun.</P>
