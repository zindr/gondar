	<P><B>Harare <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>African capitals... what can I say, it is always a bit interesting but there is very little in terms of tourist attractions.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bulawayo <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nice introduction to Zimbabwe city life, I enjoyed the centre and also a few places at the outskirts where I went with a local that I met.</P>
	
	<P><B>Livingston (Victoria Falls) <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The widest of all waterfalls in the world, world famous... a must see if you are around. Off course, the town is a bit overrun by tourists. Take the train out if you are in for an uncomfortable adventure.</P>
	
	<P><B>Marondera <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Smaller towns in Zimbabwe... interesting for a short visit, just to see the difference with the big cities. </P>
