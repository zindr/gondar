	<P><B>Cape Town <small>(2010-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Well equipped for the backpacking scene but not yet the real Africa. See the white drink wine and the black drink beer, and hike up Table mountain which is really nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Stellenbosch <small>(2010-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A student town, nothing much here unless you are still into the student life... a few nice bars might keep you here for a few days.</P>
	
	<P><B>Clarens <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A small and relaxed white city may be the perfect place to get started, at the verge of the mountains.</P>
	
	<P><B>Golden Gate NP <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Beautiful scenery to drive through. </P>
	
	<P><B>Royal Natal NP <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Beautiful scenery to hike, the gorge or crack hike for example. </P>
	
	<P><B>Sentinel <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Get on top of the Tugela Falls, a very nice hike up with beautiful scenery as reward.</P>
	
	<P><B>Matatiele <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just passing through, getting new shoes, this looked a quite alright place to hang out for a day.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bushmens Nek <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Hiking up to a cave for the night, with marvelous scenery around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Underberg <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>One of the small places they refer to as city, at least there are shops to fuel up before the hike.</P>
	
	<P><B>Injisuthi <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Bummer for the rain and the fog, the van Heinighen pass is said to provide superb views. </P>
	
	<P><B>Zinkwazi Lagoon <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>On route, this was a beautiful stopover to put are tent.</P>
	
	<P><B>St. Lucia Wetlands <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Maybe you should do the boat tour to see the hippo's, otherwise it is just a nice quite nature reserve to drive through.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hluhluwe Imfolozi NP <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This national park is a treat, with many sightings and interesting scenery. It is perfect for a very full day of safari. Sleeping we did in Hluhluwe village, the wildebees ecolodge.</P>
	
	<P><B>Barberton <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Quiet, safe and pleasant little city, and good for a break. Getting here from Swaziland was more than half the fun.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kruger NP <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>No wonder it comes so highly recommended, so easy to do your own game drive, with lots to see and cheap too.</P>
	
	<P><B>Panoramic Route <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The view of the Three Rondavels is very nice, and getting there from the north side is equally rewarding because of the colored barren mountains. </P>
	
	<P><B>Sabie <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>To have a break on the Panoramic route, you might end up in this small city. </P>
	
	<P><B>Dullstroom <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>While recommended by guides, this place looks like a tourist stopover in the middle of nothing. </P>
	
	<P><B>Kempton Park <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>With the safety issues in mind, getting a place in a quiet neighborhood near the airport seems a good option. There is a bar and some big shops.</P>
	
	<P><B>Soweto <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Orlando West, the tourist spot in Soweto, is quite relaxed these days and a more safe option than some areas in Joburg center.</P>
	
	<P><B>Pretoria <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The capital, ok to walk through but nothing more. Lucky for us that there was an open air concert. Cities are not a highlight of South Africa.</P>
	
	<P><B>Johannesburg <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The most interesting city in South Africa, showing the big differences between Park, Sandton, Alexandra, ... from rough townships to upmarket shopping centers. A pity it is such a dodgy place.</P>
