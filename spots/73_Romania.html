<P><B>Bucarest  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is maybe not the nicest European capital but the center of the center is quite nice and there are a few places of interest.</P>

 <P><B>Brasov  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The tourist spot of the country, with its nice center and convenient for a few side trips.</P>

 <P><B>Sinaia (Peles Castle)  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The Peles Castle is quite remarkable, the only that I visited because it was considered best of the three. The town is not interesting in itself.</P>

 <P><B>Zarnesti  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The starting place for trips into the Piatra Craiului National Park, supposedly because I did not find the start of any hikes.</P>

 <P><B>Sighisoara  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another small city, quite nice, with some castle ruins and a torture room on display.</P>

 <P><B>Sighetu Marmatlei  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another place where there should be some hiking, but I did not find them. The area was nevertheless nice to walk through.</P>

 <P><B>Oradea  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The border city was actually quite nice, so no problem to end up here for a few hours.</P>
