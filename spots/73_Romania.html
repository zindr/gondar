<P><B>Bucarest  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is maybe not the nicest European capital but the center of the center is quite nice and there are a few places of interest.</P>

 <P><B>Brasov  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The tourist spot of the country, with its nice center and convenient for a few side trips.</P>

 <P><B>Sinaia (Peles Castle)  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The Peles Castle is quite remarkable, the only that I visited because it was considered best of the three. The town is not interesting in itself.</P>

 <P><B>Zarnesti  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The starting place for trips into the Piatra Craiului National Park, supposedly because I did not find the start of any hikes.</P>

 <P><B>Sighisoara  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another small city, quite nice, with some castle ruins and a torture room on display.</P>

 <P><B>Sighetu Marmatlei  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another place where there should be some hiking, but I did not find them. The area was nevertheless nice to walk through.</P>

 <P><B>Oradea  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The border city was actually quite nice, it was good for a few hours the first time, and worth comming back for a day the second.</P>

 <P><B>Cluj Napoca  <small>(2024-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>As many cities in Romania, it is small, beautifull, and ok to hang out in.</P>

 <P><B>Sibiu  <small>(2024-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Known for its beauty, this small town is OK for a short while, and you can use it to enter the Fagaras mountains but mind the bears.</P>

 <P><B>Deva  <small>(2024-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This small city has a citadel up the mountains that draws some tourists, I was there to get to the national park down south.</P>

 <P><B>Retyezat NP  <small>(2024-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Some say this is the most beautiful national park, it was a very good two days hike going up to 2500m, with glacial lakes and great vistas.</P>

 <P><B>Timisoara  <small>(2024-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This student city has some nice river side bars, and the beautiful squares you can expect in Romania.</P>

 <P><B>Rodnei Mountains NP (Borsa)  <small>(2024-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Near Borsa in the Maramures region are nice hikes, one I did taking me 2 days with great views.</P>
