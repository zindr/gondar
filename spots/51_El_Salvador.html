	<HR>

	<P><B>San Salvador <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Fast food joints like McDonalds lined up for hundreds of meters in one part and street markets in another. If you are into the slightly rougher kind of places, despite offering nothing of particular interest here you may enjoy.</P>
	
	<P><B>Suchitoto <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Colonial city, very charming but again... just a city. Luckily I could enjoy a performance in the theatre.</P>
	
	<P><B>La Palma <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Home of the artist Fernando Llort with his naive art... for the rest it is just a town.</P>
	
	<P><B>Juayua <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you want to eat frog, be here on a Sunday. A few sidetrips for hiking are available but the town itself is just that.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tacuba <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Tacuba you may visit when entering from Guatemala or when going to visit the nearby national park which I did not because it took a lot of money for not so spectacular scenery it seemed.</P>
	
	<P><B>Alegria <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Again a nice little and charming town, up the mountain. A walk to the crater lake could keep you around for a few hours but for the rest nothing much is happening.</P>
	
	<P><B>San Miguel <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A real city, not in itself very interesting though. Often it is a hub towards the border with Honduras at either the north (Perquin) and east.</P>
	
	<P><B>Perquin <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This mountain city is OK but again not of much inherent interest. Here you can visit the museum dedicated to the civil war a few decades ago. </P>
	
	<P><B>El Mozote <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This village is a reminder of the crazy war, over 800 people were massacred, all women over 14 were raped first. </P>
	
	<P><B>Santa Ana <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nice city with some attractions in and around the city. The cathedral definitely is nice. </P>
	
	<P><B>Cerro Verde NP <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Hiking up Volcan Izalco was alright but not great. I hear the other volcano is more beautiful but in general it is just a nice place, nothing more. </P>
	
	<P><B>Imposible NP <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The forest is quite nice but there are not many animals you will spot. At the first river you will find some people, elsewhere you can have to yourself. </P>
