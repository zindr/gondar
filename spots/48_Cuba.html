<P><B>Havana  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The beautiful old town and the rich new part of town are both very nice to walk around in. Havana is a very interesting city showing much diversity, diversity that in many ways you would miss anywhere else in Cuba.</P>

 <P><B>Vinales  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This is a beautiful stretch of nature, good for walking, horse riding, cycling, ... Unfortunately the town itself is touristed as hell.</P>

 <P><B>Trinidad  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Very much appreciated by some, but aside from some tourist side-trips I do not see why. The town is touristed and somewhat boring. Nearby there are possibilities for small hikes, a ride on a steam train and beaches.</P>

 <P><B>Sanctu Spiritu  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you want to have a glimpse of Cuban city life outside of the tourist track... this town may do the trick, keeping you there for about an hour or so...</P>

 <P><B>Santiago de Cuba  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The alternative to Havana according to some but in many ways Santiago is somewhat bigger but still somewhat boring. Apparently there is a castle nearby that makes for a side-trip.</P>

 <P><B>Baracoa  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Here you can go into the jungle and swim on white palm fringed beaches... bummer that it was raining most of the time. The town itself is small but could be worse.</P>

 <P><B>Santa Clara  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The city of Santa Clara is for most a bit of a disappointment. Here you can visit the mausoleum of Che, that is about it...</P>

 <P><B>Remedios  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just a small city. I enjoyed it thoroughly because of the big Christmas party. I had nothing to do with Christmas and it was surreal in many ways.</P>
