<P><B>Istanbul  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Istanbul is really great, with its Blue Mosque and Aya Sophia, or Topkapi Palace. It is to spend a few days here. Tourists typically remain on the European side.</P>

 <P><B>Canakkale  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>stopover, the town is not of tourist interest.</P>

 <P><B>Pergamon  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Historical site, but not too interesting unless you like that stuff a lot.</P>

 <P><B>Selcuk  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The town serves as a basis to go to the historical site Ephesus, nearby beaches, and even Pamukkale, its kinda OK here.</P>

 <P><B>Ephesus  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>For all you history lovers, although overcrowded, Ephesus is quite interesting I can imagine. The library and the road going there are impressive.</P>

 <P><B>Guzelcamli  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This tourist town is the gateway to the nearby national park that offers beaches and a bit of coral to snorkel. But do not expect the most magnificent lagoon.</P>

 <P><B>Karakasu (Aphrodisias)  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The town is a weird non touristy place we ended up on route to the historical site of Aphrodisias. I enjoyed it, being almost empty and because you can still make sense of most of the ruins.</P>

 <P><B>Pamukkale  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is a remarkable natural phenomenon, the cotton castle with its hot springs and terraces, and at the time you could even swim in it. It was already a bit polluted though.</P>

 <P><B>Antalya  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A boring tourist city with nearby waterfalls that are a joke. While near the water, it is not really a place to swim. Maybe a bit worthwhile is nearby Thermessos and Aspendos.</P>

 <P><B>Aspendos Theatre  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The remains are nice, but for us it was especially cool because we say La Traviata performed there.</P>

 <P><B>Thermessos  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This ancient city was quite OK to visit, with its famous necropolis.</P>

 <P><B>Olympos  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This tourist hang-out for doing nothing was famous for an eternal fire coming from the rocks. The water is OK for a swim.</P>

 <P><B>Manavgat  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This expensive provincial capital is simply boring and the nearby waterfall is again a joke.</P>

 <P><B>Nevsehir  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This city is of no particular interest but is a gateway to the central part, Cappadocia.</P>

 <P><B>Goreme  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Goreme is a tourist town that is in the middle of Cappadocia. This is just superb for walking around, the landscape is simply amazing. The town itself was quite cheap and well equipped to deal with the many tourists. I slept in a cave, set up as a hotel.</P>

 <P><B>Ilhara Gorge  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The gorge was like an oasis in the Cappodocia area, quite nice with a river running through it.</P>

 <P><B>Underground Cities  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Christians hid in the underground cities, that are partially open for a visit. It is narrow and it gives some idea about the life they had.</P>

 <P><B>Uchisar  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Uchisar is one of the more popular towns in Cappadocia for visiting, with its natural rock citadel.</P>

 <P><B>Avanos  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Avanos was a town famous for its pottery, I thought it was a bit touristy and boring.</P>

 <P><B>Malatya  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Malatya is the city to pass when going to visit Mount Nimrod, the furthest east I went when visiting Turkey for the first time. I was there only very briefly, the people were nice but otherwise it looked like just a city.</P>

 <P><B>Nemrut Dagi  <small>(1995-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Wow, this was nice. Being on top of the mountain, with its large ancient statues. The view east was spectacular and then I knew that this was not the last trip.</P>

 <P><B>Urfa  <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Urfa is a first step into the Arab world, with people from Iran, Syria, Iraq.. running around. The city is not really of interest, but if you are on route to Syria or if you want to visit Harran then you probably stay here.</P>

 <P><B>Harran  <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A nice day trip is a visit to Harran, one of the oldest continuously inhabited spots on earth. The beehive mud houses are partly still inhabited, go in there an feel how refreshing they are.</P>

 <P><B>Dyarbakir  <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is a bit of a gray and slightly depressing city, and there is no real reason to get here, but it should do if you want a taste of the eastern Turkish city life.</P>

 <P><B>Mardin  <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Although beautifully located and nicely built on the slope of a rock, there is nothing of real interest to find, except just that. But if you are near, it is just a lovely place.</P>

 <P><B>Dogubayazit  <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is a border town, but a fairly enjoyable one and Ishak Pasha Palace is nearby. The surrounding nature is beautiful, with mount Ararat in the distance.</P>

 <P><B>Trabzon  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is not worth coming all the way here for, but the city is OK. Nearby there are a few sites to visit, but I was here mainly for getting to Georgia.</P>
