<P><B>Lome  <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The capital of Togo is quite nice to spend a few days, it is said to have a good night life. It is by far the biggest city you will find in Togo.</P>

 <P><B>Kpalime  <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>

 <P><B>Aneho  <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>

<P>Kande is a small town that you will just pass on the way to the Tamberma region.</P>
