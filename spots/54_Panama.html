	<P><B>Panama City <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A modern city, as modern as it gets in Central America. Rich and poor are somewhat more separated here. Of course, it is the place to treat yourself to food or whatever. The main highlight around is the Canal, but there is even jungle nearby.</P>
	
	<P><B>David <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The second city in Panama and a nice place to hang out for a day and to use as a base to walk the Sendero Los Quetzales.</P>
	
	<P><B>Boquete (Sendero Los Quetzales) <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>On my way back of the Sendero Los Quetzales I got a glimpse of Bouqete but I did not see any reason to visit that tourist dump.</P>
	
	<P><B>Santa Fe <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I do not understand why some are enthusiastic about this boring town and moderately interesting scenery.</P>
	
	<P><B>Carti (San Blas Islands) <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you want to visit the amazing San Blas islands with their indigenous people over land, then Carti is the town to get to first. Either visit the islands or get transport to Puerto Obaldia to go to Colombia.</P>
