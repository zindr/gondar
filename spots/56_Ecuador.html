<P><B>Quito  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The colonial part of the city is very beautiful and a joy to walk through. The tourist part offers everything you may need with a bigger diversity on food than anywhere else in Ecuador. While you can visit churches and cathedrals, mostly people head for the equator for putting an egg on a nail or walking blindfolded on it.</P>

 <P><B>Otavalo  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>On Sunday the Saturday market is still a bit interesting but only if you are looking for gift... For me it offers a glimpse of smaller cities in Ecuador.</P>

 <P><B>Tena  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A city in the jungle, Tena is quite nice although nothing really catches the eye aside from the big river splitting the town.</P>

 <P><B>Tena Rafting  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A class IV rafting trip, more brilliant for its scenery than for the rafting. The towering trees were very impressive,38 kilometers.</P>

 <P><B>Tulcan  <small>(2010-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>While nothing special or of interest, Tulcan is an OK border town on route to or from Colombia.</P>

 <P><B>Latacunga  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Hub to get north, west and to the Quilotoa loop. </P>

 <P><B>Sigchos  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Start of the Quilotoa loop, not necessarily a loop, with camping in Inslevi. </P>

 <P><B>Quilotoa Crater  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>End of the Quilotoa loop, sleeping up the rim and having a splash inside of the crater. </P>

 <P><B>Manta  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Brief stopover in this bigger city with waterfront and malls. </P>

 <P><B>Puerto Lopez  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Coastal tourist town, good for a few beers. </P>

 <P><B>Machalila National Park  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Hike through coastal dry land. </P>

 <P><B>Guayaquil  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The danger zone from before, now highly improved metropolis with its Malecon 2000. </P>

 <P><B>Cuenca  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The most beautiful city of the country, or is that Quito ? Shrunken heads in the museum, kebab on the streets. </P>

 <P><B>Cajas National Park  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Beautiful stretch of Paramo, perfect 2 day hike east to west. </P>

 <P><B>Vilcabamba  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Tourist town, place to have a beer at the plaza de armas with even vegan food around.  </P>

 <P><B>Podocarpus National Park  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The western part brings you up high in the Paramo, through some cloud forest.  </P>

 <P><B>Zumba  <small>(2019-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Crossing borders through the back door, switching transport to buslike trucks.  </P>
