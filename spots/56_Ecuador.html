	<P><B>Quito <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The colonial part of the city is very beautiful and a joy to walk through. The tourist part offers everything you may need with a bigger diversity on food than anywhere else in Ecuador. While you can visit churches and cathedrals, mostly people head for the equator for putting an egg on a nail or walking blindfolded on it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Otavalo <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>On Sunday the Saturday market is still a bit interesting but only if you are looking for gift... For me it offers a glimpse of smaller cities in Ecuador.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tulcan <small>(2010-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>While nothing special or of interest, Tulcan is an OK border town on route to or from Colombia.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tena <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A city in the jungle, Tena is quite nice although nothing really catches the eye aside from the big river splitting the town.</P>
