	<P><B>Warsaw <small>(2013-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is not as ugly as they say, at least a small part is really nice. It is also a fun place to go and have a beer, or lazy about in one of the nice parks.</P>
	
	<P><B>Wroclaw <small>(2013-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Student town Wroclaw is nice to hang out for a day or maybe two, but it lacks tourist attractions.</P>
	
	<P><B>Krakow <small>(2004-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The old capital and most beautiful city of the country, it is a favorite. I thought parts of the Wawel castle was worth a visit, although a bit expensive.</P>
	
	<P><B>Auswitsch <small>(2004-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you are near you should visit this reminder of one of the darkest periods in our history, the concentration camps of Auswitsch and Birkenau.</P>
	
	<P><B>Wieliczka <small>(2013-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The salt mines are very expensive and look a bit like a theme park. It was a tiny bit impressive, but I would not recommend it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Zakopane (High Tatras) <small>(2013-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>At the foot of the Tatras mountain range, you visit it if you like hiking. The hikes are quite nice.</P>
