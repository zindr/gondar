<P><B>Pafos  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A little city, with an airport, and some historical remnants that we did not visit.</P>

 <P><B>Polis  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A tiny city in the far corner, with some nice hiking nearby on the Akamas peninsula, like the Afrodite.</P>

 <P><B>Avakas  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>There is a gorge to do some hikign too, and you can turn back to visit Lara beach nearby.</P>

 <P><B>Troodos  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A bit of hiking is possible in the Troodos mountains, we did the Atalante. The road up there from the west is endless.</P>

 <P><B>Tseri  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just because there was a hostel, no reason to get here in this town.</P>

 <P><B>Greek Nicosia  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The Greek side of the capital was worth a day of strolling. Weird to see it split up like this.</P>

 <P><B>Turkish Nicosia  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The Turkish side of the capital was worth a day of strolling too. Weird to see it split up like this.</P>

 <P><B>Girne  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Girne boasts a beautiful harbor, and nice fortress, but because we could not drive our rental we did not visit much more in Kyrenia.</P>

 <P><B>Famagusta  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Famagusta has a very nice old town, and here you can visit part of its ghost town remainings after the 74 war.</P>

 <P><B>Ayia Napa  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Known for its coast line, we went to have a look.</P>

 <P><B>Larnaka  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A vibrant beach city, lining up restaurants. You may come across a flamingo in the nearby lake.</P>

 <P><B>Limasol  <small>(2022-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A big city considering Cyprus, packed with restaurants near the harbor.</P>
