<P><B>Oberstdorf  <small>(1980-00)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This little town near the Bodensee I visited when I was a kid.</P>

 <P><B>Eifel  <small>(2013-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The Eifel is an OK place for some simple walks through forest, offering a bit of WWII history.</P>

 <P><B>Monschau  <small>(2013-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Historic town that draws from tourism, nice to walk through.</P>

 <P><B>Gemund  <small>(2013-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>sleepover, town</P>

 <P><B>Eushkirchen  <small>(2013-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>stopover, city</P>

 <P><B>Berlin  <small>(2014-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Very nice city, with a great vibe, a lot of parks and that little bit of roughness. I loved it, and the party people will probably love it too.</P>

 <P><B>Heidelberg  <small>(2015-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The university city of Heidelberg is maybe one of the nicer stops on route to the south. You might want to visit the castle uphill.</P>

 <P><B>Rothenburg ob der Tauber  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Interesting city wall, and perfect stop in a road trip. This small city is one of Germany's most famous.</P>

 <P><B>Nuremberg  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This famous city is nice to have a break in, did not spent much time though.</P>

 <P><B>Bad Schandau  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The start of our version of the Malerweg hike, and a break in the middle as well. It is a touristy town.</P>

 <P><B>Bastei  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Main attraction of part one of our Malerweg hike, the Bastei bridge.</P>

 <P><B>Schrammsteine  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Main attraction of part two of our Malerweg hike, the Schrammsteine Tor, a huge sandstone rock in the middle of many more.</P>

 <P><B>Hinterdittersbach  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Main attraction of part four of our Malerweg hike, the path towards to border with Czechia.</P>

 <P><B>Dresden  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Definitely worth a stop, the altstadt, with monumental buildings and a bit of the roughness I liked most of Berlin. </P>

 <P><B>Leipzig  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The new hipster hot spot it seems, lovely industrial bars and restaurants, and a lot of vegan and surprisingly also Vietnamese. </P>
