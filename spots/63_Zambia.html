	<P><B>Lusaka <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Yet another African capital... the dirty market is interesting, but do not go to the city center in the evening, there are better places for getting a drink near the hostels.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kitwe <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Way out of the tourist track, no tourists and no tourist infrastructure, but for me it ended up as one of the absolute highlights in travel, serving drinks at a real Zambian party with all my new friends.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chingola <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A fairly rich town, thanks to the mining industry... still dusty though. It gives a bit a different flavor than nearby Kitwe. Note that the Congo border is near here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kapiri Mposhi <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>transit... another dusty town, a transport hub to the north.</P>
	
	<P><B>Serenje <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another dusty town, in transit... sleeping in the garden at the police office... African travel is interesting, even if there is nothing.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mutinondo reserve <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A reserve of a rich English guy, open for the public... nice for a brief stop with some forest and big boulders dotting the place, nice if you have a way to cross the 25 km dirt road.</P>
	
	<P><B>Isoka <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>On transit, transport is not easy... another dusty town, it is always waiting and waiting, finally after many hours the truck moves... I could be in front, a sign of respect.</P>
	
	<P><B>Muyombe <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Getting stuck again, in the middle of nowhere... but this way it is fun, it is really a taste of real life.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chama <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>And getting stuck again, trying to get from A to B... another dusty town, here I ate centipedes.</P>
	
	<P><B>Lundazi <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Almost there, a glimpse of civilization but not there yet.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chipata <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Crossing borders... and border towns... not the worst here!</P>
