	<P><B>Santiago <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A quick stopover for a day, just to have a taste of the Chile big city life. It was OK, I liked it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Puerto Natales <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Gateway to Torres Del Paine, a charming city with wooden houses and very fine landscapes.</P>
	
	<P><B>Torres Del Paine <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Hiking and hiking, in brilliant diverse scenery for about a few days to over a week... I loved it, superb, do not miss it when near.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cerro Castillo <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A border crossing in the middle of nowhere, not a place to linger around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chile Chico <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The border town, where you can try your luck to get out. Transportation is not very well developed in this region.</P>
	
	<P><B>Puerto Ibanez <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Small small town, trying to get out, again... all buses were full, so... hitch-hiking again.</P>
	
	<P><B>Coyhaique <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Nothing to do here... but finally I reached a city, just trying to get transport to the next one. Public transport here is a disaster.</P>
	
	<P><B>Puerto Montt <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A tourist city, and a hub for the areas around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ancud <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Transit, just passing through, but seemingly also an OK town.</P>
	
	<P><B>Castro <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nice main city on the island Chiloe, good for a relaxed day or maybe two.</P>
	
	<P><B>Punihil <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Watching the penguins with a little boat trip, funny little buggers.</P>
	
	<P><B>Arica <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Chilean border town, in transit from Peru to Bolivia, it is not too bad to get stuck here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Patacamaya <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Transit from Arica in Chile to Oruro in Bolivia, a really cool place, up high (> 4600 m.), really nice trip.</P>
