	<P><B>Moscow <small>(2012-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A few days on transit in the biggest European city... well yeah... it is interesting, people run instead of walk, it is expensive, there are a few nice museums, and of course, the red square, the Kremlin... these speak to the imagination. I loved it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sergiyev Posad <small>(2012-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The most popular ring city with its Lavra, easily accessed from Moscow for a short visit, it shows a number of churches. The town is nothing of interest.</P>
