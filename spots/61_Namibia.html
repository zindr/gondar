	<HR>
<P><B>Windhoek  <small>(2010-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe the most boring capitol of all of Africa, maybe of all the world.</P>

 <P><B>Keetmanshoop  <small>(2010-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A transport hub... nothing more I guess... amazing how empty even the (ahem) big cities are in Namibia.</P>

 <P><B>Luderitz  <small>(2010-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Strange place, a small city... with some German architecture and not much more... and wind, a lot of wind... and sand, a lot of sand.</P>

 <P><B>Helmeringshausen  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Remarkable that it is actually on the map... a shop, a gas station, a hotel and that is almost it... here I got stuck hitch hiking for 24 hours.</P>

 <P><B>Maltahohe  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A brief stop, changing cars... Again a place that is small, and there is nothing... a trend in Namibia.</P>

 <P><B>Solitaire  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Again a stopover when hitch hiking... this is the shop, hotel and gas station all in one.</P>

 <P><B>Sesriem  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The entry of the national park boasting the dunes, just a few tourist hotels and camps.</P>

 <P><B>Sossusvlei  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The number one draw of Namibia... the dunes, very nice indeed. Dead Vlei was the best.</P>

 <P><B>Swakopmund  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A funny looking city... German style... well, not really my thing but many tourist come here for the beach and various outdoor sports.</P>

 <P><B>Hentiesbaai  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A stopover with my new driver, and another tiny place in an overwhelming big setting.</P>

 <P><B>Cape Cross  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Again a stopover... en route to the north... and a place to see a large number of seals... the rest is just sand, sea and mountains in the distance.</P>

 <P><B>Opuwo  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Finally, the real Africa, you have to get to the north to start seeing African culture and style. I instantly loved it.</P>

 <P><B>Outjo  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>transit, stopover to Etosha National Park.</P>

 <P><B>Etosha NP  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Do not go in rainy season... then it is not just a tourist dump, but one without animals. The people running the place are rude (white bosses) and incompetent (black servants). I hear when visiting in the good season, spotting animals is dead simple.</P>

 <P><B>Otjiwarango  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Quick stopover and goodbye to my French driver, the town is typical for Namibia, small and completely insignificant.</P>

 <P><B>Ondangwa  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>An African city... a main street with... not much around, but fairly OK to hang out if you are in that sort of thing.</P>

 <P><B>Rundu  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just another African city... I liked it for the short time that I was there.</P>

 <P><B>Katima Mulilo  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Not the worst of border towns... but no reason to stay here.</P>
