	<P><B>Tehran <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Not one of the worlds most beautiful capitals to say the least, overcrowded, chaotic, difficult to get around and to the main sites. There is not much of interest, aside from maybe a few museums and another bazaar.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tabriz <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>My first Irani city, a place with no real tourist attractions. The bazaar is probably the highlight and the people are hospitable.</P>
	
	<P><B>Yazd <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Mud-brick cities, giving a glimpse of earlier settlements many years ago, I enjoyed my short stay in this desert town. </P>
	
	<P><B>Esfahan <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Esfahan is plain beautiful and triggers a nice feel because of the fairly relaxed atmosphere, offering the bazaar, mosques, gardens, ... </P>
	
	<P><B>Shiraz <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>With tourist prices being so high, most of what was in Shiraz was out of my budget which made it a dull place. It offers the gateway to Persepolis.</P>
	
	<P><B>Persepolis <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The Throne of Jamshid built in 512 BC are interesting ruins and although I am not the worlds most history minded person I kind of recommend it, unfortunate of the almost 8 US entrance fee.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bam <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Ancient city ruins, quite nice at the time but unfortunately destroyed largely by an earthquake (26/12/2003) which killed 10000 people. The new town was dull.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kerman <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is not a tourist city, just a place where you might end up if you are on route to Sirch for example.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sirch <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The small town of Sirch has some hot springs in a nice natural setting.</P>
	
	<P><B>Zahedan <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A get-out-this-border-town-as-soon-as-possible place. Nothing of any interest, unless you still have to arrange for a visa for Pakistan.</P>
	
	<P><B>Taftan <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The border town is tiny, the ride out there was simple brilliant, racing through the desert. ride up to the border in the back of a pick-up... welcome pakistan, back into a bit of roughness</P>
	
	<P><B>Kashan <small>(2012-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>a day trip to Kashan, being reminded of the tremendous hospitality in Iran and enjoying a glimpse of what were the Persian gardens and houses</P>
	
	<P><B>Mashhad <small>(2012-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>the holiest of holy places in Iran, and sneaking in the shrine pretending to be a Muslim was really worth it... amazing, grown men crying in the face of allah and his most important Shi'ite prophets</P>
	
	<P><B>Qouchan <small>(2012-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>just a quick stopover, at night, on my way to Turkmenistan, and a glimpse of ordinary north eastern Iran</P>
