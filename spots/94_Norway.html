	<P><B>Trolltunga <small>(2014-09)</small>:</P></B>

	<P><B>Fredvang (hike) <small>(2015-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A first hike starts a bit down from Fredvang and goes to the other side accross the mountain trhough very boggy terrain. It gave us a first glimpse from up above over the Lofoten.</P>
	
	<P><B>A <small>(2015-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The shortest name possible for a town, a small (ex?) fishing community that seems to cater to tourists. It is were the road ends, so you might just stand theree gazing over the cliff.</P>
	
	<P><B>Himmeltindan <small>(2015-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>For the views you may want to hike up here, and stay a bit at the beach afterwards to recover. </P>
	
	<P><B>Hemmingsvaer <small>(2015-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Crossing several small villages, not much to do here but you could always have a stroll like here in this Venice of the Lofoten (aheum). </P>

	<P>Going down this insignificant road towards the Tengelfjord, just for parking the car to sleep. </P>
	
	<P><B>Tromso <small>(2015-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is as nice here as they say, but it would be so much nicer if it would not be so dirt expensive. Anyway, very enjoyable. </P>
	
	<P><B>Senja island <small>(2015-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Same same but still a bit different from the Lofoten, it provides very nice scenery and many nice places to camp.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hamn I Senja <small>(2015-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>No idea why this one is in the lonely planet.</P>
	
	<P><B>Silfjord <small>(2015-08)</small>:</P></B>

	<P><B>Anderedalen NP <small>(2015-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A short hike from the 860 brings you to the lake Andervatnet, a trek through the NP is another option. </P>
