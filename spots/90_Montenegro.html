<P><B>Podgorica  <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Surreal in many ways, Podgorice is not the capital you might expect but the vibe is very nice. Happy to have visited the old part of town too, the second time I was there.</P>

 <P><B>Zabljak (Durmitor NP)  <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The small city of Zabljak is the gateway to the Durmitor National Park. The national park offers some very nice walks.</P>

 <P><B>Kolasin  <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Charming little city on route between Durmitor (very beautiful gorges) and Podgorice, good for a brief stopover.</P>

 <P><B>Cetinje  <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The former capital has a few historic buildings to show, maybe worth a brief stopover.</P>

 <P><B>Kotor  <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe the number one tourist city of Montenegro, beautiful because of its nice old town and bay.</P>

 <P><B>Budva  <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Tourists are everywhere in this big tourist hub within Montenegro, going out and laying on the beach. I left almost immediately.</P>

 <P><B>Sveti Stefan  <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the many places for visiting a beach, Sveti Stefan also has a few public beaches for relaxing a bit.</P>

 <P><B>Bar  <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nearby Bar where I passed the first time, near its old city, we just had a break at some camping in an olive garden. After the strenuous hiking, a break was welcome.</P>
