	<P><B>Sarajevo <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A beautiful city center with nearby clear evidence of the recent war. A 12.5 Euro tour brings you a bit closer to that war, with a look into the tunnels.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kostajnica <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Border crossings, not a place for visiting in itself.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bosanska Krupa <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>on route, while hitch-hiking.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sanski Most <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Hitch-hiking could bring you to this nice little city. Not much to do though.</P>
	
	<P><B>Jajce <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>One of the few tourist cities within Bosnia, it offers a waterfall and an old town with citadel. Maybe even this town had limited things on offer.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mostar <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This city is very well known, with its UNESCO bridge and old town. It is nice for having a walk around for a day.</P>
	
	<P><B>Blagaj <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Seemingly this is the camping area near Mostar, with a river and a few historic sites around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Procitelj <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another historic site on route, with a fort to hike up and down for an hour.</P>
