	<P><B>Islamabad <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The squared administrative capital was a quite interesting days out. But in terms of tourist attractions, there is nothing.</P>
	
	<P><B>Rawalpindi <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The dirty, polluted and overcrowded twin-city of Islamabad where the people actually live is also quite interesting. The slums are dramatic.</P>
	
	<P><B>Lahore <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The most tourist city, at the border with India. It has some attractions, nice market streets and a beautiful fort. Do not miss the Sufi dance performances in nearby temples. </P>
	
	<P><B>Quetta <small>(2002-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Bordering Afghanistan, this city is a mix of different people, street and markets, interesting place although there is not much for tourists.</P>
	
	<P><B>Peshawar <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The gateway to Afghanistan through the beautiful Kyberpass, this city is OK for spending a day with an interesting mix of people and a vivid market place to explore.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gilgit <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I left quickly, there is not much to do but the scenery around is very nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Minapin <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The tiny town had one guesthouse that is surprisingly good. The only reason to be here is the hike up to base-camp of the Rakaposhi mountain, and that is brilliant. It is a four to five hour hike up there, and you could sleep at basecamp.</P>
	
	<P><B>Karimabad <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is a beautiful valley, and the town itself is nice too... and you could do an OK day hike up and down to base-camp of Ultar mountain.</P>
