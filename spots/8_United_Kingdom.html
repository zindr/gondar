	<P><B>London <small>(2014-00)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Famous London is another world city, offering interesting museums that are often free. The mix of cultures results in great world kitchen.</P>
	
	<P><B>Canterbury <small>(1991-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The small city of Canterbury is often visited for its famous cathedral.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cambridge <small>(2009-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Cambridge is home to one of the most famous universities, which I visited as part of a congress. Related to that university are a few historical buildings. The town is ok, and is much more English than world city London. </P>
	
	<P><B>Edinburgh <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Capital of Scotland, with its castle. It was ok, maybe a bit less than expected. Maybe it was the weather.</P>
	
	<P><B>hike Meall a Bhuachaille <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A first hike in the Cairngorms national park, alright but not that spectacular.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kinlochewe <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>While the town is just a tiny tourist hub, getting there and away is really beautiful. Seemingly there are some very good hikes around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Plockton <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A tiny somewhat beautiful town on the road. While picturesque as promised, the scenery near is more to my taste.</P>
	
	<P><B>Portree <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This town is the living proof that you do not visit upnorth Scotland for its citylife.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Old Man of Storr <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Nice hike up the mountain with spectacular scenery, reminding me of the Lofoten in Norway a bit.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Quiraing <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Short hike to some stone formations we did not find. The scenery was again very good.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Fairy Pools Glen Brittle <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Short hike because it was near to the loosy camping ground (better camp wild)</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Bruach Na Frithe <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Very good hike up the mountain, on top in the snow the ridges. Beautiful.</P>
	
	<P><B>Fort William <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The main street was a pleasant place to stretch the legs, good for an evening I guess.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Steall Falls <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Stretching the legs is also possible nearby Fort William, just a small hike up to the waterfall. </P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Cobbler <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>An OK last hike in Scotland, nothing that brilliant though. The small cities nearby, no reason to visit that it seems.</P>
	
	<P><B>Killin <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This small town is picturesque, with its broad river, but that is about it. You could hike up the hill, we did not. </P>
