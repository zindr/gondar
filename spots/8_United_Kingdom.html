<P><B>London  <small>(2014-00)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Famous London is another world city, offering interesting museums that are often free. The mix of cultures results in great world kitchen.</P>

 <P><B>Canterbury  <small>(1991-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The small city of Canterbury is often visited for its famous cathedral.</P>

 <P><B>Cambridge  <small>(2009-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Cambridge is home to one of the most famous universities, which I visited as part of a congress. Related to that university are a few historical buildings. The town is OK, and is much more English than world city London.</P>

 <P><B>Edinburgh  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Capital of Scotland, with its castle. It was OK, maybe a bit less than expected. Maybe it was the weather.</P>

 <P><B>Hike Meall a Bhuachaille  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A first hike in the Cairngorms national park, alright but not that spectacular.</P>

 <P><B>Kinlochewe  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>While the town is just a tiny tourist hub, getting there and away is really beautiful. Seemingly there are some very good hikes around.</P>

 <P><B>Plockton  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A tiny somewhat beautiful town on the road. While picturesque as promised, the scenery near is more to my taste.</P>

 <P><B>Portree  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This town is the living proof that you do not visit up-north Scotland for its city-life.</P>

 <P><B>Hike Old Man of Storr  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nice hike up the mountain with spectacular scenery, reminding me of the Lofoten in Norway a bit.</P>

 <P><B>Hike Quiraing  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Short hike to some stone formations we did not find. The scenery was again very good.</P>

 <P><B>Hike Fairy Pools Glen Brittle  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Short hike because it was near to the loosy camping ground (better camp wild)</P>

 <P><B>Hike Bruach Na Frithe  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Very good hike up the mountain, on top in the snow the ridges. Beautiful.</P>

 <P><B>Fort William  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The main street was a pleasant place to stretch the legs, good for an evening I guess.</P>

 <P><B>Hike Steall Falls  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Stretching the legs is also possible nearby Fort William, just a small hike up to the waterfall.</P>

 <P><B>Hike Cobbler  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>An OK last hike in Scotland, nothing that brilliant though. The small cities nearby, no reason to visit that it seems.</P>

 <P><B>Killin  <small>(2016-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This small town is picturesque, with its broad river, but that is about it. You could hike up the hill, we did not.</P>

 <P><B>Llandudno  <small>(2017-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Welsh coastal city overrun by old tourists, nice enough for an afternoon. You could hike up the hill for a view, we did not.</P>

 <P><B>Caernarfon  <small>(2017-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Known for its castle, this walled city near the water is nice for a stroll.</P>

 <P><B>Nantlle Ridge Hike  <small>(2017-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the many hikes around, which will have you walk the ridges. We were unlucky with the fog and cut the hike short. The nearby touristy town of Beddgelert offers an OK camping too.</P>

 <P><B>Betws-y-Coed Town and Hike  <small>(2017-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A town that serves as a base for hiking, with a few campings nearby. We enjoyed the diverse 23km hike through forest and fens from the north of town to the south as far as Pont-y-Pant.</P>

 <P><B>Pontcysyllte Aqueduct  <small>(2017-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A curious aqueduct that serves to pedestrians and boats, worth a small detour if you are near.</P>

 <P><B>Chester  <small>(2017-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The walled city of chester is nice enough to spent a few hours strolling around and on the walls itself.</P>

 <P><B>Liverpool  <small>(2017-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This city we liked, free museums and interesting cathedrals, and a very nice vibe.</P>

 <P><B>Scaffel Pike Hike  <small>(2017-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>For a hike in the Lake District, we started from Wasdale Head and circled to the Scaffel Pike and Sprinkling Tarn. It was beautiful, but shortish (only about 4 hours).</P>

 <P><B>Ravenglass  <small>(2017-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Staying on a camping in nearby Saltcoats we stumbled on tiny Ravenglass by accident, a good one. It is a curious tiny little town in a beautiful bay.</P>

 <P><B>Buttermere  <small>(2017-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A road trip crossed this beautiful valley going from Loweswater to Keswick. Many people are here for hiking too.</P>

 <P><B>Windermere  <small>(2017-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Do not make the mistake we made and stop at Windermere, the tourist part is more south in Bowness-on-Windermere.</P>

 <P><B>Clitheroe  <small>(2017-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A stop on the road, but probably not worth the detour.</P>

 <P><B>Manchester Airport  <small>(2017-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>While close, we did not visit Manchester and only used it to fly in and out.</P>
