<P><B>Nairobi  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The city in Nairobi is as close as you can get to any big western city, at least in the center. Security improved a lot in most areas between 6AM and 9 PM, well dressed, polite and helpful people. The Nairobbery of before is illustrated by the many shops behind bars. I was fun.</P>

 <P><B>Naivasha  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This small town can be a base to visit Hell's gate, a crater lake and crescent island. The free part of crescent island was alright, and the town was not the worst.</P>

 <P><B>Masai Mara  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A 2 day safari in the NP made us see some lions, buffalos, cheetahs, elephants, giraffes, ... but I skipped on the crocs and hippos that took at least 3 days to include the pool.</P>

 <P><B>Nakuru  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A city in Kenya, not really interesting but still nice. It is the gateway to visit the nearby NP, if you can spare the money. I visited somewhat boring Lake Elementaita for 2 US instead.</P>

 <P><B>Garissa  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Change to get a bus, not a place to stay.</P>

 <P><B>Wajir  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Short stop on route, not a place to stay.</P>

 <P><B>Moyale  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A two country border town, we just took a ride on top of a cow transport truck from 14h to 10h... the trip of hell that I would not want to have missed... through the desert through the night.</P>

 <P><B>Isiolo  <small>(2006-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Home of the colorful Turkana people, and other tribals. The town itself is not really interesting beyond that. I enjoyed being able to eat camel meat.</P>

 <P><B>Malaba  <small>(2006-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>For being a border town this town of Mabala was actually really OK. Again, nothing much to do though.</P>
