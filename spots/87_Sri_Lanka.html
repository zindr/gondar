	<P><B>Colombo <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This is the kinda city all tourist say it is not worth a visit, but the alternative Negombo has become just that. I thought Colombo was ok for a day.</P>
	
	<P><B>Haputale <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nice hill city in tea country, a good place to start some walks. The scenery is nice and the people still OK.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tea Country Hike <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A hike from up to the viewpoint (not really interesting) and further all the way to Bandarawella was very nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Nuwara Ellya <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Little England, well, true... good enough for a few hours just passing through.</P>
	
	<P><B>Jaffna <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A city, a real one with a bit a rougher edge and nice. I like this stuff, why, I do not know myself.</P>
	
	<P><B>Point Pedro <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Quiet place, at the northern end. It is good for only a few hours, but an easy side trip from Jaffna. </P>
	
	<P><B>Pollonuwara <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Temple complex from earlier times, but like all tourist attractions in Sri Lanka, ridiculously expensive. I skipped all other expensive sites and attractions.</P>
	
	<P><B>Trinco <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The city in the north east, a base for beaching I guess. The city is OK and the people nice. The beaches are not so amazing.</P>
	
	<P><B>Uppuveli Beach <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>OK for half an hour, this beach that comes recommended. I think it is a bit overrated but at least there are not too many tourists.</P>
	
	<P><B>Nilaveli Beach <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another beach spot, with at the time almost no tourists. So, OK for an hour of sitting in the sand.</P>
	
	<P><B>Galle <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Visit the Dutch fort around here... it will keep you busy for half a day. The area has it fair share of tourists already.</P>
	
	<P><B>Unawatuna <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Popular beach place, with some white sand beaches and restaurants.</P>
