	<P><B>Athens <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Athens was not particularly interesting. It is home of the Acropolis, which I missed out on.</P>
	
	<P><B>Delfi <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The oracle of Delfi is known, and in town there are some ruins and a museum which are OK. </P>
	
	<P><B>Itea <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Itea is a small coastal place near Delfi with boring shallow water to have a swim in.</P>
	
	<P><B>Naflion <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Naflion is a tourist city in the south of the Pelopponesos, handy because of its vicinity to various other places.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tolo <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Tolo is maybe the best place if you like swimming in the sea, here there are actually waves and sand.</P>
	
	<P><B>Epidavros Theatre <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The theatre was really interesting, especially observing how well the sounds made it from the centre all the way up. </P>
	
	<P><B>Mykene <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>While of historical importance, I thought this was just a bunch of old stones.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mavromati <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>At the time this was just a tiny little village with some ruins that they were uncovering. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting there, drinking coffee with my girlfriend and watching how nothing seemed to happen.</P>
	
	<P><B>Methoni <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>There is nothing of interest here, with a wave-less beach.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sparta <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just another city in the Pelopponesos.</P>
	
	<P><B>Olimpia <small>(1994-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Here you can observe the track and some old building, fairly nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ioannina <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>stopover, on route from Albania to the Meteora.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kalambaka <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The city of Kalambaka, with nearby tiny town Kastraki, are the gateway to the Meteora, beautiful landscape with monasteries on top of mountains.</P>
	
	<P><B>Thessaloniki <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The city of bars, a good vibe and just a nice place to spend a day or maybe more. There are some historical interesting sites to visit as well.</P>
