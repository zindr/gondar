<P><B>Bogota  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A capital and an interesting place for a few days, Bogota combines an army of beggars with nicely dressed upmarket people. The Botero museum is free and really nice. The Museo del Oro maybe is also very good, free on Sundays.</P>

 <P><B>Cartagena  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The tourist town of Colombia is enjoyable for a day to visit its old colonial part and to get a glimpse of the modern part of town.</P>

 <P><B>Taganga  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A tourist spot, also for the Colombians, to relax or party. Here, or in nearby city Santa Marta, a number of side trips can be arranged. Tayrona national park is very nice for beaches with a glimpse of jungle. Here you start your Lost City trek through the jungle.</P>

 <P><B>San Gil  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The outdoor sports capital of the country. So I did a small bungee jump, a parapente and a rappel... rafting was also possible, and some other stuff. The city is nice enough for a day but offers nothing extra in itself.</P>

 <P><B>Medellin  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The most recommended city in Colombia is Medellin, with rich and poor to some extent nicely divided... guess what is most interesting ? The city is liked especially by those that are in for a party.</P>

 <P><B>El Retiro  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small slow pace little city, a good day trip from Medellin to get a glimpse of the other side.</P>

 <P><B>San Agustin  <small>(2010-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This nice town has some outdoor opportunities and also has an archaeological site on offer. Most people, including the Colombians, like the town.</P>

 <P><B>Capurgana  <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A border town like this one is an exception, it is nice, laid back and interesting for tourists because of its beaches and jungle. From here you need to take a boat in the morning to Turbo, a place where you do not want to spent time.</P>
