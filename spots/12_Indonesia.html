	<P><B>Jakarta <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is crazy out here, just passing the road is an endeavor. And honestly, there is virtually nothing to do or see here, just a hectic life, overcrowded, busy, dirty and terrifying traffic.</P>
	
	<P><B>Yogyakarta <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The cultural highlight of Java is Yogjakarta, a busy town without high skyline. There are some things to visit in the city and it is a towards sites like Borobudur and Pramanbanan. The latter, Pramanbanan, is the biggest Hindu temple complex in Java (9th century) and while not as spectacular as Borubudur, it still is worth the visit. </P>
	
	<P><B>Borobudur <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>In Java this is one of the most important tourist landmarks, the massive Buddhist temple. I liked it a lot. Together with Bagan in Myanmar and Angkor in Cambodia this is one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in South-East Asia.</P>
	
	<P><B>Karangpandan <small>(1998-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This is a base for a temple visit and nature walk which were ok.</P>
	
	<P><B>Candi Sukuk <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This small Hindu temple near Solo you could expect in Central America. The nature around offered a beautiful hike through the rural area, through the forest, passing through villages, crossing over rivers between mountains and valleys.</P>
	
	<P><B>Probolinggo <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>stopover for visiting Bromo</P>
	
	<P><B>Mount Bromo <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The volcano Bromo is exquisite. For me this volcano looks as if it is taken out of the earliest times when dinosaurs ruled the world. Watching sunrise there was something to never forget. You will be here with hundreds of other tourists though!</P>
	
	<P><B>Banyuwangi <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This little town is not really special in itself, but it served as a gateway to the Ijen Crater. </P>
	
	<P><B>Kawah Ijen <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>At the time there was only limited industry, with people manually digging for sulfur. The sulfur-gas coming out of the crater-holes nearly suffocated me, they got me out. The clear blue lake in the crater was beautiful. It was one of the best experiences, being a whole day with the miners.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gilimanuk <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>stopover, for taking the ferry Java - Bali</P>
	
	<P><B>Denpasar <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Like most places in Bali, the people treat you like money belts. I just had a brief stopover.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ubud <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Ubud is the cultural capital of Bali, and maybe the only place in Bali that was still a bit nice. You can visit the Monkey Forest Temple or do little walks in the area to for example Goa Gajah, some ruins. I was lucky enough to witness a Hindu burial.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kediri <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The town from which to visit Tanah Lot is not worth going to. </P>
	
	<P><B>Tanah Lot <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The rock temple in the sea is OK.</P>
	
	<P><B>Klungkung <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This town with friendly people has nothing to offer to tourists.</P>
	
	<P><B>Padangbai <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>You should only get here to take the ferry to Lombok, or to witness the millions of bats at sunset in the bat-cave some few kilometers out of town. The cave is used for the burial-ceremony. </P>
	
	<P><B>Bratan Lake <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is a lake, but nothing special. The famous temple is just a small insignificant looking temple.</P>
	
	<P><B>Lovina Beach <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It should be the alternative to overly spoiled Kuta beach, with its black sand, beaches, dolphin watching, snorkeling, diving, ... but I didn not do any of that... A nearby Buddhist monastery was nice, the waterfall really crap.</P>
	
	<P><B>Alas Purwo NP <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This natural resort was completely isolated from the outside world. The ocean at Trianggulasi was too rough to swim, but the desolate white sandy beaches are nice. Surfing may be possible nearby (Plengkung).  There is wildlife that you are not likely to see unless you head to the feeding grounds (Sadengan). </P>
	
	<P><B>Dieng Plateau <small>(1998-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The Dieng plateau an hour up-mountain from Wonosobo is a scenic area that shows some boiling mud pools and a small colored lake. There are some very old temple ruins too, older than Borobudur and Pramanbanan, but far less spectacular.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sumenep <small>(1998-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This is a first of the two main cities of Madurai island just north of Java, for me a bit insignificant. Maybe it is different when you are here during the bull fights.</P>
	
	<P><B>Pamekasan <small>(1998-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This is a second of the two main cities of Madurai island, again a bit insignificant.</P>
	
	<P><B>Pangandaran <small>(1998-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A touristy beach resort that grew out of a fishing village. It is a national park with some jungle but mainly it is a place to swim a little and relax. I would not have gone there.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bogor <small>(1998-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The city is a bit a get away for rich people living in Jakarta, I guess, with its botanical garden to show for. I thought it was boring, but there is a direct bus going to the airport if you want to escape crazy Jakarta. There should be some hiking and game viewing around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bukittinggi <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This relaxing city in the hills has nearby some uninteresting caves. from the WWII, a fort and some views. Nearby are Harrau Valley and Lake Maninjau. </P>
	
	<P><B>Lake Maninjau <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Danau Maninjau is kinda impressive as a crater lake and the road towards it are even more so. But there is not that much to do.</P>
	
	<P><B>Parapat <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Parapat is just a gateway city to Lake Toba, it is not of interest in itself.</P>
	
	<P><B>Lake Toba <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>For some reason this lake should attract many tourist, but I think it is just a lake. Tourism stopped when I was there, it was ultimately boring. </P>
	
	<P><B>Berestagi <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Berestagi is a nice little mountain city, especially worth the visit for the surrounding sites. You will be able to walk in the jungle or hike up the mountain and descend in some volcano craters. If you are into hot water springs, they are there but unfortunately re-build as a swimming-pool, so don not expect to much.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ketambe (Leusser NP) <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>As an alternative to Bukit Lawang for Oran Utan spotting it also offers jungle treks in Leusser National Park. I saw several other species  and thoroughly enjoyed the warm water spring in the middle of the jungle with its rapid alternation between very hot and very cold water while you are looking up a wall of trees on the nearby mountain.</P>
	
	<P><B>Medan <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The port city Medan is just a city, you will pass through it if you take the ferry to Malaysia.</P>
	
	<P><B>Dumai <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Talking of ugly border towns with border town people lying their boots off. Well, this is it. You don not want to end up here for more than a few hours.</P>
	
	<P><B>Makassar <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>No reason to come here, but I enjoyed it with my couchsurf host and his friends. The Dutch fortress is the only tourist attraction and not worth it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Rammang Rammang <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This very beautiful spot I got to because of my couchsurf host and his friends, a very cool side trip in the Karst mountains.</P>
	
	<P><B>Rantepao <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The tourist town is the gateway to the Tora Toraja, original traditional villages in the middle of the rice fields in the hills. The town itself is nothing special, but you could visit one of the burial ceremonies.</P>
	
	<P><B>Palu <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>An ordinary city with little to offer to tourists, except nice people and food.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gimpu (Lore Lindu) <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The base for going trekking through the jungle. I tried it, on my own... I almost got myself killed there. If you do not show proper respect for the jungle, it will eat you.</P>
	
	<P><B>Walk Sulawesi Rantepao 3 <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Including a funeral, famous around here, a walk in this area is beautiful.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Sulawesi Rantepao 1 <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>through the hills Sad an Batututomonga ... it is very beautiful walking up and down here, with rice fields and traditional houses.</P>
	
	<P><B>Walk Sulawesi Rantepao 2 <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P></P>
	
	<P><B>Maumere <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A port and/or an in between city when traveling on Flores. Also here there is nothing special, just ordinary Indonesian life as it is on Flores.</P>
	
	<P><B>Marapokot <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>One of the harbors in Flores, and the closest harbour to Makassar (24 hours, only). Note that this is only a harbor, nothing else.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mbay <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Staying the night here at some families place, very nice. Mbay is just the town near the port of Marapokot.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bajawa <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A quick stopover, it is where I could have slept (most tourists do) if I did not do so in the valley.</P>
	
	<P><B>Flores villages Hike <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>From Bajawa a hike downhill took me a day, passing several villages and ending at a hot-spring.</P>
	
	<P><B>Watijuli <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Traditional village, a tourist attraction along my way down. It is quite nice to experience.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tolulelo <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another traditional village that is part of the tourist attractions around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mala <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The end of my hike down was at Mala, where I was invited to stay the night at someone's porch. I really enjoyed the natural hot spring in the nearby river... really enjoyable if you are there on your own like me.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kelimutu Crater Lake <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>THE tourist attraction on Flores, three differently colored lakes. If you are around, surely you should not miss it, all in all it was quite nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kelimutu walk <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P></P>
	
	<P><B>Moni <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The tourist town near Kelimutu, not the nicest place unless you like tourist hangouts.</P>
	
	<P><B>Larantuka <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another harbor town, nothing special but enjoyable nevertheless. Catch boats to the east, north and south here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kupang <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The capital of West Nusa Tenggara, a student city and probably the nicest city around while also here there is not that much to keep you busy.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kefamenanu <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I like places like Kefa, although I see no reason to recommend it to others for any reason. Most tourists come here for a nearby tour to traditional villages, I was here by accident.</P>
	
	<P><B>Oilasi <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Presumably boasting a nice market, but maybe there is nothing out here. I had fun as I lived together with a bunch of students for a few days.</P>
	
	<P><B>Boti <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A tourist attraction, but I do not know why ? I walked up here and then walked back again.</P>
	
	<P><B>Soe <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Not much happening in nice little Soe.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Timor Boti <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>From Oilasi a day hike went to Boti, no idea why I did.</P>
