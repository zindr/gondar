<P><B>Riyadh  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A slightly interesting Dehriya (At-Turaif World Heritage) and Masmak make this pedestrian unfriendly environment not totally tourist unfriendly, and you can go out to the end of the world if your buget allows.</P>

 <P><B>Jeddah  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A moderatly interesting old town make this otherwise pedestrian unfriendly environment OK, you may also visit the world tallest fountain at the corniche.</P>

 <P><B>Taif  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This hill escape from the heat in Jeddah is popular with locals, it should be fine but I did not spent much time in the city as I was hijacked in a friendly way by locals. The nearby Ash Sharaf hills were OK for a visit.</P>

 <P><B>Abha  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This other hill town boasts a good hike down the highest mountain, jebel sawda, and a visit to nearby and very nice historical town Rijal Alma.</P>

 <P><B>Yanbu  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The diving place, with its walkable streets and nice parks and old town, was my favorite city in the country. </P>

 <P><B>Medina  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The burial place of Mohammed, it has a few nice spots, and if you can enter the fenced part of the mosque, it is nice and interesting. </P>

 <P><B>Al Ula  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Famous for the Madain Saleh, with Nabatean tombs, it is especially beautiful for its scenery.  It has an open air museum too. </P>

 <P><B>Tabuk  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Probably much more of interest in the near future, as part of the Neom project, now it does not show much of interest. </P>
