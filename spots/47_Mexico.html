	<P><B>Mexico City <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A very nice centre Mexico City has and it probably is well worth a few days, easy to get in and out with bus or plain.</P>
	
	<P><B>Taxco <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Not far from the capital this city may give a second perspective on Mexican city life</P>
	
	<P><B>Grutas de Cacahuamilpa <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A good kilometre of spectacular cave scenery, unfortunately I shared it with hundreds of school children and the obligatory guide that shows coincidental features like rocks that look like a head or something.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cuernavaca <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A slightly boring but beautiful place, it clearly is an upmarket place.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cancun <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>To be honest, this one I simply passed by because it is everything tourists like me do not want.</P>
	
	<P><B>Valladolid <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nice entrance to the Yucatan peninsula, Valladolid allows for some sidetrips and is on the way to Chitzen Itza.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chitzen Itza <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Maya city of the early days which is especially impressive because of its echoing system. A visit would take about two hours and I think should not be missed when around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Merida <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A Mexican city, not much more... allowing for a few side trips. For me it was the place to celebrate New Years, clearly not a festive highlight in Mexico.</P>
	
	<P><B>Campeche <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another Mexican city but smaller than Merida and thus somewhat more boring, still it clearly is the real life.</P>
	
	<P><B>Palenque <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a smaller city but I preferred it over the tourist hangouts a little bit out of the city in the direction of the nearby Palenque ruins which are ok to visit.</P>
	
	<P><B>San Cristobal <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>My favourite city in Mexico, although somewhat touristed. Some sidetrips are possible, do not miss the crazy church in the nearby village San Juan Chamula.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cañon del Sumidero <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I also enjoyed a trip to the Cañon del Sumidero, two hours of boat tripping for spotting wildlife amidst a canon.</P>
