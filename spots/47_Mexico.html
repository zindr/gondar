<P><B>Mexico City  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A very nice center Mexico City has and it probably is well worth a few days, easy to get in and out with bus or plain.</P>

 <P><B>Taxco  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Not far from the capital this city may give a second perspective on Mexican city life</P>

 <P><B>Grutas de Cacahuamilpa  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A good kilometer of spectacular cave scenery, unfortunately I shared it with hundreds of school children and the obligatory guide that shows coincidental features like rocks that look like a head or something.</P>

 <P><B>Cuernavaca  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A slightly boring but beautiful place, it clearly is an upmarket place.</P>

 <P><B>Cancun  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>To be honest, this one I simply passed by because it is everything tourists like me do not want.</P>

 <P><B>Valladolid  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A nice entrance to the Yucatan peninsula, Valladolid allows for some side-trips and is on the way to Chitzen Itza.</P>

 <P><B>Chitzen Itza  <small>(2009-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maya city of the early days which is especially impressive because of its echoing system. A visit would take about two hours and I think should not be missed when around.</P>

 <P><B>Merida  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A Mexican city, not much more... allowing for a few side trips. For me it was the place to celebrate New Years, clearly not a festive highlight in Mexico.</P>

 <P><B>Cenotes Cuzama  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A Dysney like side trip to cenotes like Chelentun with horse carriages and swimming in a blue water cave, why not, it is beautiful and we are tourists.</P>

 <P><B>Campeche  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another Mexican city but smaller than Merida and thus somewhat more boring, still it clearly is the real life.</P>

 <P><B>Palenque  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just a smaller city but I preferred it over the tourist hangouts a little bit out of the city in the direction of the nearby Palenque ruins which are OK to visit.</P>

 <P><B>Yaxchilan  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>As part of a tour and a bit far out the temples of Yaxchilan are quite nice, although the concert of howler monkeys may have added to the experience, and it is the jungle alright.</P>

 <P><B>Bonampak  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>On route to Yaxchilan you would visit Bonampak with its small ruins with colored designs.</P>

 <P><B>San Cristobal  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>My favorite city in Mexico, although somewhat touristed. Some side-trips are possible, do not miss the crazy church in the nearby village San Juan Chamula.</P>

 <P><B>Sumidero Canyon  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>I also enjoyed a trip to the Sumidero Canyon, two hours of boat tripping for spotting wildlife amidst a canon.</P>

 <P><B>Teotihuacan  <small>(2023-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>I guess this long lasting proof of old civilizations is worth the small trip from the city.</P>

 <P><B>Chihuahua  <small>(2023-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>City up north, nice for a walk around, skipped the dunes though.</P>

 <P><B>Creel  <small>(2023-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small touristy town at the verge of the copper canyon, you can take the train here.</P>

 <P><B>El Divisadero  <small>(2023-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Tiny overlook over the copper canyon, possible to reach by bus from Creel.</P>

 <P><B>El Fuerte  <small>(2023-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Why go all the way by train, you can take the bus from here, this small but nice enough city.</P>

 <P><B>Los Mochis  <small>(2023-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The end of the line for the copper canyon trail, just a city.</P>

 <P><B>Topolobampo  <small>(2023-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Want to hit the beach, get here from Los Mochis and relax.</P>

 <P><B>Tijuana  <small>(2023-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Border city, with all that comes with it, interesting enough for a day.</P>

 <P><B>Tijuana Beach  <small>(2023-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Want to hit the beach, get here from Tijuna and have a drink.</P>
