<P><B>Rome  <small>(2015-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A beautiful historic city with its Colosseum, perfect for a city trip when you are not swamped by tourists.</P>

 <P><B>Vatican City  <small>(2015-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The smallest country in the world, a museum within Rome, a big cathedral, filled with history.</P>

 <P><B>Tre Cime di Lavadero (Sexten)  <small>(2015-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe the most famous hike in the dolomites can be started from Sexten, going up to Tre Cime from the north taking about 6 hours.</P>

 <P><B>Cortina d'Ampezzo  <small>(2015-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the few slightly bigger cities, quite alright, catering for tourists.</P>

 <P><B>Crado da Lago  <small>(2015-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A four hour hike not far from Cortina starting from Passo Di Giau to the lake is one of the many options, not too spectacular though but nice.</P>

 <P><B>Venice  <small>(2015-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is clear why this city draws so many tourists each year, a very nice place to visit for its peculiar atmosphere with the many canals.</P>

 <P><B>Verona  <small>(2015-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Often recommended Verona is another city worth paying a small visit.</P>

 <P><B>Vigo di Fassa  <small>(2015-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Vigo is a tourist hub for walking the nearby mountains, and in winter it is a ski resort. For us it was the end of the hike.</P>

 <P><B>Campitello di Fassa  <small>(2015-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Campitello is yet another tourist hub to ski and hike. For us it was the start of the hike across the Catanaccio.</P>

 <P><B>Chiavenna  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A camping stop in cheaper Italy offered a good opportunity for a short stroll in the small but nice old town, and a pizza nearby our camping. </P>

 <P><B>Pisa  <small>(2023-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is not so big, but you can see the tower, and it is quite nice if you are out of tourist season.</P>

 <P><B>Firenze  <small>(2023-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Firenze is about beauty, a very nice city to have a stroll with beautiful buildings and squares.</P>

 <P><B>Rimini  <small>(2023-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>In late autumn this beach place is probably kinda quiet, and that is alright, good for a stroll on the nice beach.</P>

 <P><B>Arezzo  <small>(2023-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is not a big place, and it looks nice, a bit like the other cities around. </P>

 <P><B>Siena  <small>(2023-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Impressive squares, monumental buildings, so if you are near this would be a city to visit. </P>

 <P><B>San Gimignano  <small>(2023-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A great tiny old city on a mountain top, good for a quick visit in between Siena and Firenze. </P>
