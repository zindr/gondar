<P><B>Antananarivo  <small>(2013-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Beautifully located, but maybe a bit dodgy at night. There is no reason to skip this interesting city. There are a few side trips you can do from here too.</P>

 <P><B>Majunga  <small>(2013-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This is a nice vibe city, just for hanging around. A bit up north you can do some beaching as well. Here the waterfront is very active in the evenings with people eating and drinking, or just sitting.</P>

 <P><B>Ankarana NP  <small>(2013-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The cheapest way to see the Tsingy, peculiar rocks peaks, is to visit the small ones near the highway. You probably see some lemurs as well.</P>

 <P><B>Diego Suarez  <small>(2013-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Also referred to as Antisirana, this city I guess is especially popular with old white men and their very young black girlfriends. It is alright though, with a nice evening street action which is rare in this country, good vibe.</P>

 <P><B>Antsirabe  <small>(2013-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Popular getaway from the more dodgy Tana, this city is quite pleasant and offers a few walks in the nearby villages. It is also the most obvious hub going west, south or north.</P>

 <P><B>Fianarantsoa  <small>(2013-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The starting point for taking the train, or what is left of it, to Manakara. The upper town is very nice and it offers what you could expect cities have to offer.</P>

 <P><B>Manakara  <small>(2013-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Ending up here, you probably took the train for the trip itself. If you do not immediately turn back, you can sit on the beach for a while, or go and have a drink somewhere.</P>

 <P><B>Ambalavao  <small>(2013-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A nice small city, it is just a perfect size. This is the gateway to the Andringitra National Park.</P>

 <P><B>Andringitra National Park  <small>(2013-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>There is a national park, but you can also visit the area just outside that park which is not promoted locally. It is a much cheaper alternative.</P>

 <P><B>Morondave  <small>(2013-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Near the Baobab street, famous all over, this town offers some ugly and polluted beach, but popular with the locals. There is no harbor.</P>

 <P><B>Allee de Baobabs  <small>(2013-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This is the postcard place of the country, impressive baobabs lined up, once just part of the huge forests and today the only ones remain standing. Note 80 percent of jungle disappeared here.</P>

 <P><B>Tamatave  <small>(2013-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Also referred to as Toamasina, this city is not as bad as some say, a waterfront that is probably good for having a drink and there is some action as should in cities this size.</P>

 <P><B>Foulpointe  <small>(2013-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Seemingly the locals come here for beaching, I wonder why ?!</P>

 <P><B>Ambohimanga  <small>(2013-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The old kings had there tiny little castles on one of the seven hills north of Tana. The one you can still visit is quite OK, dating back a few hundreds of years.</P>

 <P><B>Ivato  <small>(2013-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Peculiar, but this airport city actually is nice in its own right. The crock farm was depressing but the tiny city is actually worth staying for a few hours.</P>
