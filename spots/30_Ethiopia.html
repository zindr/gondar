	<P><B>Addis Ababa <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A relaxed city although I am sure it has its problems. There maybe is not all that much to do around here but the atmosphere is nice. Here, finally, you can escape the monotone Ethiopian food, injera.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gondar <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A tiny castle is the big attraction here, along with an old church. Unfortunate that prices for tourist attractions are quite high. The town itself is nice though, for me the nicest in all of Ethiopia. We ended up in the friendliest brothel-bar-butcher, brilliant.</P>
	
	<P><B>Debre Birhan Selassie <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The old church is quite remarkable, one of the main sites in Gondar.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gondar Castle <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The castle is exceptionally remarkable, one of the main sites in Ethiopia.</P>
	
	<P><B>Metema <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Getting stuck at the border town, just wait it out.</P>
	
	<P><B>Debark <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Gateway to the Simien mountains is a small place to do final shopping only. It is unfortunately a bit touristed.</P>
	
	<P><B>Simien mountains Hike <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The Simien mountains took us 5 days to cover, really beautiful and interesting with our armed guide and donkey to carry our stuff. I loved it, only the days were a bit too short because of hiking only 5 hours a day.</P>
	
	<P><B>Lalibela <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Christianity, the orthodox way. These pricey rock cut churches are quite interesting. I spent orthodox Christmas there, together with over 10000 pilgrims. The town itself is not very nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Dese <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Forced stopover. In Ethiopia everything goes very slow, and because there is no public transport during the night because of possible insurgencies stopovers become inevitable.</P>
	
	<P><B>Arba Minch <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Brief stopover on our way to Jinka. There should be possible game viewing nearby.</P>
	
	<P><B>Khonso <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Interesting stopover because we got stuck, again. We ended up chewing qat, the local soft drug... brilliant, a Japanese guy, me and a bunch of women including a mother and her teenage daughter. </P>
	
	<P><B>Jinka <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The market in Jinka you visit to see the Mursi tribes people, a picture costs 2 dollar. But anyway, the colorful market is interesting. </P>
	
	<P><B>Yabelo <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Forced stopover. Get the first transport out of here. Coming up here was cool though.</P>
