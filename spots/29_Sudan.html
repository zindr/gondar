<P><B>Khartoum  <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>I really liked Khartoum for its hospitable people and the Nile swirling around, despite it looking as a construction wharf. The city has a very relaxed feel to it and even at night you feel safe.</P>

 <P><B>Omdurman  <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Omdurman with its market also is nice. But especially the Sufi-dance will be remembered as highlight, every Thursday.</P>

 <P><B>Gedaref  <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The last stop to the border did not have any attraction but also here it was quite nice talking to people. I should have stayed a bit longer in Sudan.</P>

 <P><B>Wadi Halfa  <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A desert town at the border, nothing to do and not much room for bargaining transport down to Khartoum (it took 28 hours). Beautiful desert scenery and nice and interesting talks with the Sudanese people.</P>
