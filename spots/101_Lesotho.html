	<P><B>Butha Buthe <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Passing through, after the border crossing. Note the the northern road is your only option with a 2wd to get to the Sani-Pass.</P>
	
	<P><B>Katse Dam <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>An allright place to visit, but getting there is by far the most important part of the trip.</P>
	
	<P><B>Maseru <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is a capital, but there is no real reason to visit unless you like the more dodgy places. Sleeping we did in Thaba Bosui.</P>
	
	<P><B>Malealea <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>There is beautiful scenery around for hiking. The community based tourism, as they promote themselves, is maybe more about advertising yourself.</P>
	
	<P><B>Qatchas Nek <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Like most places in Lesotho, getting there is most of the fun.</P>
