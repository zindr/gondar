<P><B>Tokyo  <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The city of cities in the region... it was a very nice introduction into Japanese city live... enough to keep your amazement going for a few days. I was very lucky with couchsurfing.</P>

 <P><B>Yokosuka  <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Because I found a couchsurf host, no other reason to come here. But it was fun for the brief moment that I was there, a start-off point to visit nearby Karakuma with its temples.</P>

 <P><B>Kamakura  <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If it is temples that you are after, some of them you will find here. For the rest it seems to be just another Japanese town.</P>

 <P><B>Takayama  <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another city of temples with a lot of old Japanese tourists.</P>

 <P><B>Nagoya  <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Industrial Nagoya boast good food, I am told... but remains nothing but an industrial city to get in and get out again.</P>

 <P><B>Inuyama  <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Here you can find a castle, I just wanted to find a ride out of town. I eventually found one, it was brilliant because Japanese people are very hospitable too.</P>

 <P><B>Kyoto  <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The city of temples... and it is true, there are a lot spread around the city. Still, it is more than just temples... This city is quite nice.</P>

 <P><B>Osaka  <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you look for another Tokyo, this is it... here it gets as cosmopolitan as it gets in Japan. I liked it.</P>
