	<HR>

	<P><B>La Paz <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>De facto the capital of Bolivia, high up in the mountains. It has a few nice parts, and the vibe is nice too, good for a few days. You might want to tackle the 6000m. high mountain that is near.</P>
	
	<P><B>Oruro <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a Bolivian city, nothing too special, it was our entry into the country and already our first confrontation with a road block.</P>
	
	<P><B>Uyuni <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The gateway to the Salar, it is a small city which knows how to deal with tourists. There is not so much reason to linger on.</P>
	
	<P><B>Salar <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The biggest salt plains in the world, amazing, a highlight in Bolivia including the cacti island in the middle somewhere.</P>
	
	<P><B>Alti Plano 1 <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A three day tour brings you from the Salar to this place and back, with its geysers.</P>
	
	<P><B>Alti Plano 2 <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Through the Altiplano with lakes at high altitude, of different colours with different fauna.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tupiza <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Quebradas, just some beautiful mountains to walk in... near this town. The town is nothing of real interest, but ok.</P>
	
	<P><B>Potosi <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The highest city in the world, it seems... on transit. You could go and visit the mines, but beware that it may be unhealthy doing so.</P>
	
	<P><B>La Cumbre <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The start of the Choro trek, a popular and interesting hike down through different layers of vegetation. We loved it, it took us 1.5 days to reach Chairo.</P>
	
	<P><B>Challapampa <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Camping the night halfway the Choro trek.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chairo <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The end of the Choro trek, and luckily we could take a truck out in the morning going to La Paz.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Choro trek <small>(2011-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A very nice downhill trek of 2 days.</P>
	
	<P><B>Rurrenabaque <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The town for trips to the jungle or the pampas, we did the latter. The town was simple, ok but nothing special.</P>
	
	<P><B>Santa Maria  <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Gateway to the Pampas, a small place on route.</P>
	
	<P><B>the Pampas <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Diverse wildlife in these wetlands, fishing for piranhas and swimming with dolphins, caipibaras, caiman...</P>
	
	<P><B>Trinidad  <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Nice city to just hang out... it reminded me of Africa, a bit rough but interesting.</P>
	
	<P><B>Santa Cruz <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Boring modern town, with hummers on the street... I do not get why it is often recommended.</P>
	
	<P><B>Samaipata <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A tourist place near Amboro national park, good for visiting the cloud forest. We did not, we should have, because the town itself is nothing of interest.</P>
	
	<P><B>Villamontes <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Real Bolivian city, a bit boring though, but also a bit interesting... the gateway to Paraguay, although you could just as well take the bus from Santa Cruz that also passes here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sucre <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The political capital of Bolivia is a nice colonial town, a bit too nice and tidy for me.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tarija <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a city with some possibilities for tourists, with wine making tours for example. I was stuck there because of another ridiculous set of road blocks.</P>
	
	<P><B>Yacuiba <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just another border town to pass, we got there but turned back.</P>
	
	<P><B>Villazon <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The main border town with Argentina.</P>
