<P><B>San Ignacio  <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the highlights if you believe the guidebooks, a tourist street and nearby a few touristy attractions. It was a good place to get started.</P>

 <P><B>Mountain Pine Ridge  <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>An easy gettaway from San Ignacio is this park, with an OK cave and a bit of nice water scenery.</P>

 <P><B>Belize City  <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Once a capital city, the biggest city of the country was quite alright to hang around for a day.</P>

 <P><B>Belmopan  <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>More a joke than a capital city, probably the tiniest in the world, it takes only half an hour to get a sense of what it is like.</P>

 <P><B>Hopkins  <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A popular backpacking place at the Atlantic, Garifuna style. It is a relaxed place but that seems to be it.</P>

 <P><B>Placencia  <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The upmarket version of Hopkins, filled with tourists and rich people, but maybe also quite boring. Anyway, it was good for the three hours I was there.</P>

 <P><B>Cockscomb Basin Forest Reserve  <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A beautiful stretch of forest, but without much animals unless you are very lucky to see the jaguar.</P>

 <P><B>Jalacte  <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A border crossing like no other, through someones garden, and now I know that it is not official so you end up illegally in Guatemala.</P>
