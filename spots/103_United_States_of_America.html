<P><B>Washington DC  <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A layover, just enough time to visit the Mall with its white house and memorials.</P>

 <P><B>Houston  <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A layover, just enough time to visit the city if only it did not rain cats and dogs. From what I have seen I did not miss too much though.</P>

 <P><B>New York  <small>(2019-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>After a layover a few years earlier, I ended up here again for 4 days. Loved it, it is of course one of these places, iconic. </P>

 <P><B>Apgar  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the entries for Glacier National Park, enjoy the lake, hike up to Apgar Fire Lookout, or do the Avalanche Lake Trail hike.</P>

 <P><B>Polson  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If it were not for the ridiculous sim card system, we would not have been here longer than an hour, we stayed the night trying to fix it at Walmart.</P>

 <P><B>Jackson  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>After a long trip down, cowboy town Jackson is the touristic entry to the Grand Teton, unfortunately a bit too early in the year to do the grand hike, but beautiful scenery around. We hiked up death canyon, did the paintbrush hike and bearpaw.</P>

 <P><B>Yellowstone  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A national park not to miss, unfortunately only the south was open because of flooding. Geysers I had seen before, but the prismatic eye, wow.</P>

 <P><B>Cody  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The drive from Yellowstone to Cody is great, and there are probably worse towns then cowboy Cody to end the day.</P>

 <P><B>Thermopolis  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Having missed the Yellowstone Mammoth hot spring with its limestone terraces, this is a great alternative, and comes with a free hot spring to have a swim.</P>

 <P><B>Saratoga  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>After Thermopolis, there is not so much reason to be here, it is a hot spring again.</P>

 <P><B>Laramie  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe one of the nicest cities for a break, with more than just one nice street, this town just had a bit of a local festival going on.</P>

 <P><B>Fort Collins  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Dropping in on a Saturday night out, it seemed like a really nice city, with a lot of cool bars that are not simply lined up on main street. </P>

 <P><B>Moraine Park  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Estes Park is the tourist entry to this park, where we did the Sky Pond trail and the Fern Lake trail. </P>

 <P><B>Fairview Curve  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A road trip around Colorado's Rocky mountains offers brilliant views, all around. </P>

 <P><B>Boulder  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Known as the happiest city in the US, weed has something to do with it, it was nice for a beer, and nearby  we could stretch our legs doing the flatiron. </P>

 <P><B>Denver  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>While quite boring in the center, there is a very hip area just outside, understandable that it attracts many people, upgraded industrial sites of before. </P>

 <P><B>Sheridan  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Driving the wide expanse of Wyoming, you have to stop for a sleep somewhere sometime. </P>

 <P><B>Butte  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>After Dayton, Lovell and Bozeman, this city was odd enough to make it truly intersting, with its victorian houses that showed its former mining grandeur. </P>

 <P><B>Missoula  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A recommended city, and sure enough, it is a nice enough place to take a break and have a beer, with its cool bars.</P>

 <P><B>Many Glacier  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the best places for superb scenery in the US, just do the iceberg lake hike, or the grinnel lake view hike. Depending on the time of year, some other options arise.</P>

 <P><B>Cut Bank  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>After nearly dead Shelby, this city, although small, proved nice enough for a break, enjoyed it.</P>

 <P><B>Two Medicine  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another place for hiking, we did the Dawson Pass, same same but different.</P>

 <P><B>Going to the Sun Road  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Popular, undoubtedly because it is doable sitting on your ass as much as because it is beautiful, we were one of the very first to get in that year and loved it as the sun rose.</P>

 <P><B>San Diego  <small>(2023-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nice city to get out and have a beer or two, they love their Padres.</P>

<P>A historic, museum kinda place that serves as a small two hour side trip.</P>
