<P><B>Phnom Penh  <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Richly decorated temples and beautiful colonial houses mixed with a mother and child sleeping on the streets, very cool to be. At the time Phnom Penh with its poor was still a bit dodgy at night. The war history is also part of tourism, like nearby killing fields of Choeng Ek and torture chambers of Tuol Sleng: prison 21.</P>

 <P><B>Sihanoukville  <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The sandy beaches were, at the time, still a bit deserted. The people were still nice, the surroundings beautiful with an open landscape dotted with trees. This is the port to enter the country by boat.</P>

 <P><B>Siem Reap  <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The town is the gateway to Angkor Wat, it was even then already touristed. White people eating happy pizzas; for 8 dollar you got a pizza loaded with weed.</P>

 <P><B>Angkor  <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The Khmer temples dating from 9th to 13th century were simply amazing. Angkor Thom, the square city with the Bayon in the center. 1. Bayon, a temple, at first site nothing special but that changes as you go in... 2. Angkor Wat, the biggest Buddhist temple in the world and maybe mausoleum 3. Preah Khan, powerful jungle-trees on and in the temple ruins. For most people this is the most unforgettable part of the complex. Only these three temples would require a day, I spent 3.</P>

 <P><B>Battambang  <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Battambang is the second city of Cambodia... amazing as it is not too much of a city. It had a nice vibe, but nothing much of tourist interest.</P>
