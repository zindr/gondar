<P><B>Kiev  <small>(2010-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Wide lanes, monumental communist buildings, surely this city keeps you there for some time. The Lavra is undoubtedly a tourist attraction, and a walk on the river front.</P>

 <P><B>Lviv  <small>(2010-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This western oriented city in Ukraine is very nice to wonder around. You could walk up the hill, or hang out in the old port of town and enjoy the vibe.</P>

 <P><B>Odesa  <small>(2010-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>I simply loved this place, regretting I was there on my own because it is the place to get a beer on one of the many terraces. I admit, I was there on a public holiday, which may have made a difference.</P>

 <P><B>Kamianets-Podilskyi  <small>(2010-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Known for its caste, which was OK, this city was OK for a day.</P>

 <P><B>Uzgorod  <small>(2010-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This border city was actually quite charming as well.</P>

 <P><B>Simferopol  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The capital of the Crimea is just another city.</P>

 <P><B>Sevastopol  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>At the time being a Russian flavored part of Ukraine, it was an interesting and enjoyable place to be, especially at the waterfront in the evenings.</P>

 <P><B>Yalta  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A bit overrated, and popular with local tourists. There is an historical significance to the place and a few sites to visit, but for the rest it is just another tourist hub at the water.</P>

 <P><B>Bakhchysarai  <small>(2012-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This smaller, more rural place, you visit to get into the nature with some monasteries and a fort. It was nice out there.</P>
