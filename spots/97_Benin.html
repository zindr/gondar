	<P><B>Porto Novo <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The capital is much smaller and much more relaxed than Cotonou and alright for spending a few hours too.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cotonou <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>While not suggested to be the nicest of places, it does offer a very interesting market and some opportunities to be amazed.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ouidah <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Ouidah is a quite nice city, big enough to be entertained and boasting the point of no return at the end of the slave route.</P>
	
	<P><B>Abomey <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Abomey may be the nicest city of Benin, with its history as the center of a huge kingdom of which you can visit some of the remains.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ganvie <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Probably the most touristy place in the neighborhood, the stilt villages of Ganvie are quite interesting albeit touristed.</P>
	
	<P><B>Natitingou <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The northern city that is used to visit the Pendjari National Park and the Somba region that is like the Tamberma in Togo is a small city like everything here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Boukoumbe <small>(2015-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The border town of Boukoumbe is a good place to enter Benin, with its share of the Tamberma culture to see.</P>
