<P>This is as crazy as it gets, believe me... huge marble buildings, super big lanes and a lot of other completely worthless showoffs... was it Vegas, was it Abu Dhabi, was it a science fiction movie... who knows... and boring as hell</P>

 <P><B>Dasoguz  <small>(2012-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A change of plan brought me here, in this Russian city... not really of interest but sleeping in just a local her house made it all worth it.</P>

 <P><B>Konye Urgench  <small>(2012-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Some say this is a highlight... well, I thought it was nice... it is a bunch of stones that at least meant something for the Muslims here... more interestingly, the people were so nice...</P>
