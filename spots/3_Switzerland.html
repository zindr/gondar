 <P><B>Joriseen  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A first hike up to 2770 meters, to have a look at the lake which was somewhat iced.</P>

 <P><B>Casaccia hike  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>An up and down from town offered nice high mountain scenery, some lakes and woody slopes, keeping us busy for nearly 7 hours.</P>

 <P><B>Tamboalp hike  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>An up and down from Splugen offered nice mountain scenery, with a view on the pass to Italy, keeping us busy for 5 hours. We camped in Italy, at the Montespluga lake.</P>

 <P><B>Goscheneralp hike  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A circular around a lake proved especially nice at the northern end, because of its boulders and vegetation,4 hour hiking worth the trip. The nearby Furka pass offers a superb road trip, beautiful scenery too.</P>

 <P><B>Five Lakes trail  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>An up and down from Tasch, and Zermatt which is surprisingly big and has a few interesting looking streets, brought us to the 5 lakes trails, popular, but maybe the gondolas do take away a bit of the adventure. For us it was over 9 hours of hiking. </P>

 <P><B>Grindelwald  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A quick stop in this beautifully located city, surrounded by mountains, gave a hint of what we would miss out on, rain was coming.</P>

 <P><B>Bern  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A quick stop to get a glimpse of city life in Switzerland, Bern has a tiny old center that was very nice to stroll around in on a sunny afternoon. Of course, how delightful it was, Switzerland is for the hiking, the rest is too expensive.</P>
