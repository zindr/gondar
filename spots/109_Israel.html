<P><B>Jerusalem  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A city with history like few other, loved standing on temple mountain, and wandering the narrow streets, as well as the more modern part of town.</P>

 <P><B>Mitzpe Ramon  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Amidst the biggest crater, at the highest point, the scenery is very nice, in the Negev desert, I also did the Ramon's tooth loop, Makhtesh Ramon.</P>

 <P><B>Metsada  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>After hitchhiking, and busses, through OK Dimona and touristic Ein Bokek, Masada is a treat, some of the history was still clear, it was nice.</P>

 <P><B>Ramallah  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Visiting Israel without visiting the West Bank would have been wrong, so I went for having a taste. Not that much is happening there, but I would not want to have missed it. </P>

 <P><B>Nablus  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This city is quite nice, with its walled city still a clear part intertwined with the new city. It is also a place where maybe the tension with Israel is a bit more clear.</P>

 <P><B>Bethlehem  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The old part of the city was again quite nice, and the wall is a vivid reminder of the current and past situation. You can visit the birthplace of Jesus, or that is what they say. </P>

 <P><B>Tel Aviv  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The old part of the city was again quite nice, and the rest is hip and trendy, cool places but expensive. And it is nice to have the beach. </P>
