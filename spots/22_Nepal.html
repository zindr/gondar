<P><B>Kathmandu Valley  <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The valley combines three cities, Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur. If you have no time to actually go out and explore the Himalayas, go to Nagarkot to see the mountain range when sun rises early in the morning. Most entry fees were steep at the time, but easily avoided taking an alternative way in.</P>

 <P><B>Kathmandu  <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A nice vibe relaxed colorful city with old temples and modern possibilities, food from all over and whatever you want to make your trip more easy. It is one of the most beautiful cities to wander around in, both during the day as later in the evening. The Buddhist monkey temple of Swayambhunath offers a nice view, avoid the high fee or ignore it. Pashupatinath, the Shiva Hindu temple is interesting for a few hours, you can see cremations, monkeys and cows running down the stairs. Then there is the huge stupa of Bodhnath, the largest in the country.</P>

 <P><B>Bhaktapur  <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This city is said to be the least modern of the three with very nice architecture going back to the 17th century, all you find at the main square (durbar).</P>

 <P><B>Patan  <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This city is just across the Bagmati River and is much quieter than Kathmandu. The atmosphere is again very nice, only unfortunate for the high entrance fee for the Royal Palace.</P>

 <P><B>Pokhara  <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This ugly touristy town has all the amenities, I saw it without tourists, boring, but it serves a trek in the Annapurna region. in my opinion. Especially now that there are no tourists, it is annoyingly empty. It serves as the base for going trekking around the Anapurna and the like. I only did a day walk to Sarangkot and that was ok. There are apparently also some limestone caves at Mahendra Gufa or Rupa and Begnas Tals lakes, maybe they are worth it.</P>

 <P><B>Chitwan NP  <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This area in the Terai offers jungle and wild life. Sitting on the back of an elephant can bring you quite close to the rhinos around. A walking safari showed some sorts of crocodiles, a bear, and some series of birds and insects. If you are (un-)lucky, there are also tigers and rhinos to run into.</P>

 <P><B>Sanauli  <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This is a relaxed but very small border-town. There are worse places to get stuck but try not to anyway.</P>
