	<P><B>Tashkent <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Undoubtedly the most developed city in central Asia, you will even find bars to go out. I enjoyed it, but it is still hard recommending it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Samarkand <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>UNESCO, ahem. A place with a name like few others, like Timbuktu. Now, it is a tourist hub with a few very nice 14-15 century building good to keep you busy for a day.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bukhara <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>UNESCO, ahem. More of a city than Khiva and more diverse than the tourist centre in Samarkand, this place is my favourite of the three.</P>
	
	<P><B>Khiva <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>UNESCO, well yeah... it is kinda cool to walk around a mud walled city with a history of being on the silk road and the main spot for merchandising slaves.</P>
	
	<P><B>Urgench <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The main city nearby Khiva, as an entry and exit point... use it only for that. Even the market here is not a place to enjoy, and the rest is just ordinary mainstream old sovjet style</P>
	
	<P><B>Nukus <small>(2012-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A Russian type of city with a recommended art museum (no idea why)... and of course, an entry/exit point from Turkmenistan.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kokand <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Here to cross the border and to find out that the road to the border was closed... so, sleep and go back again... I stayed with my taxi driver in a nearby village, weird and interesting.</P>
