	<P><B>Yangon <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>So sweet and charming, I loved this cityless city, the capital at that time before it was moved to Naypyidaw. I enjoyed the Shwedagon Paya although the entrance fee of 5 $ may be a bit too much.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bagan <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Famed for its ancient Buddhist temples dotted around, it is very beautiful. I was fun walking around for a few days. The city is not nice at all, too touristed.</P>
	
	<P><B>Pakkoku <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A real city two hours upriver from Bagan, without the tourists, offering a very interesting perspective on the less tourist-oriented Myanmar small-city-life.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hsipaw <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A travelers hang-out, small and rural but yet well equipped with the necessities of travelers. The walks in the villages and nature around kept me busy for longer than I thought. The waterfall is because of the walk up there worth going out there for. The hot(warm)-water spring is not though.</P>
	
	<P><B>Nyaung Shwe (Inle Lake) <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Beautiful scenery of all the villages and their gardens on the water, and with all the boat travel around. The town feels like a tourist rip off. Accommodation is cheap though and you can do several things out here including trekking (do it yourself), boat-trips to nearby villages (organize yourself), ...</P>
	
	<P><B>Taunggi <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A quite interesting day trip from Nyaung Shwe if you like to see the less touristed side. The market is very big and you can find all other stuff like cheap Myanmar food or a payable drought beer out here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mandalay <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A firm tourist hub, I avoided it. Surprisingly the people at the local bus-station were exceptionally friendly, also here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bago <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Not much of interest here unless you want to pay up 10 FEC to visit some of the pagodas. The town is friendly though. If it is very short, like for me, a stopover here is not the worst that can happen.</P>
	
	<P><B>Thaton <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Because of the colonial mansions and nice environment it can be a worthwhile few days out of Yangon. It is the kind of place you would enjoy because of the atmosphere and nice interaction with locals.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hpa An <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The trip getting there was very nice. I should have done the trip to Mawlamyine a bit further.</P>
	
	<P><B>Pyin-Oo-Lwin <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>British colonial styled hill station, it looked very nice with pleasant cool temperatures but it was a bit dull. For all you waterfall lovers, there is one close by.</P>
