<P><B>Dublin  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe the nicest about Dublin, is just hanging out in a pub with live folk music, maybe even having a bite, life irish stew.</P>

 <P><B>Galway  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A quick pass by, this small city looks nice for a day. From here on west is the connemara peninsula.</P>

 <P><B>Connemare National Park  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Very popular hike up the mountain, with a nice view on the bay and the hills.</P>

 <P><B>Connamare road trip west  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The peninsula is quite beautiful, swirling the narrow road near the coast. First stop, Errislannan.</P>

 <P><B>Connamare road trip south  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Following the coastline, enjoying the quite outdoors, a few stops at the beach, for example in Dogs Bay.</P>

 <P><B>Corofin  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This small town in the Burren that is the base to the national park is good for a beer, a meal or even a hostel.</P>

 <P><B>Poulnabrone Dolmen  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Very often photographed are the Dolmen, so ok, if you are around.</P>

 <P><B>Cliffs of Moher  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>An Irish highlight, the cliffs, with very nice views on the steep shore. Steep are also the entrance fees though.</P>

 <P><B>Killarney National Park  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A nice enough hike up the hill brings you through forest and a small waterfall, and do not miss the nearby Gap of Dunloe. The town of Killarney is maybe a bit too much touristtown. </P>

 <P><B>Kenmare  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A small town, OK for a quick stopover on route to Beara peninsula.</P>

 <P><B>Glengarriff Woods Nature Reserve  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A small hike up in the forest, beautiful. </P>

 <P><B>Healy Pass  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Scenic pass cutting through the Beara peninsula. </P>

 <P><B>Eyeries  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Tidiest town, at least last year. Towns here are colorful, but small.  </P>

 <P><B>Allihies  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another small town, good to park near the beach, and have another Irish stew. </P>

 <P><B>Kinsale  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Road trips bring you to various places, also this small city which was good for a short walk through and a drink. </P>

 <P><B>Cork  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The second city, with a few nice streets, but maybe we could have skipped it. We camped in nearby Blarney. </P>

 <P><B>Cobh  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Again another small city on the road, good enough to have a quick stop and relax at the seafront. </P>

 <P><B>Ballycotton Cliff Walk  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Not the cliff walk in Moher, but if you are near and want to freshen your nose, this may be it. </P>

 <P><B>Kilkenny  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A city on a Friday evening, people are on the move, all ages, not necesserally sober. With a bit of luck you end up in the right pub.</P>

 <P><B>Glendalough Park  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A very popular park near Dublin, part of the Wicklow way. The hike is nice and some parts are scenic, with some deer to spot as well. </P>

 <P><B>Sally Gap  <small>(2019-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The drive from Glendalough to Enniskerry covering the scenic Sally Pass was very nice.</P>
