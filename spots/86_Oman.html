	<HR>
<P><B>Muscat  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is maybe the only thing big in the country aside from the mountains and the desert, but it does not blow your mind at all. The small area with tourist attractions is easily visited in a few hours. I liked a few other parts of town.</P>

 <P><B>Sohar  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A fort will entertain for 10 minutes, a walk on the waterfront too. It is the first city you pass coming from the UAE when crossing at Buraimi.</P>

 <P><B>Yanqul  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Do it for getting there and away. The scenery is quite brilliant, especially on the road to Sohar. The town itself is like most towns in Oman, small and insignificant.</P>

 <P><B>Nizwa  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Visit the Friday market and the fort to at least do something aside from hiking, in Oman. It is the tourist hub as signaled by the few busloads that are dropped near the fort and that roam the market.</P>

 <P><B>Birkat Al Mouz  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The gateway to one of the better known mountains, Jebel Akhdar, if you are up for a hike or have a car to go and enjoy the view. The town itself is small, just big enough for having something to eat.</P>

 <P><B>Sayq  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small village that is the perfect start for a hike down to Birkat Al Mouz. The village is charming in its own right, on the slopes, the walk is rough at places but really beautiful.</P>

 <P><B>Jebel Akhdar View  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>I got up hitchhiking and being lucky, pushing the big all terrain car to see where it could go. The views, really nice.</P>

 <P><B>Bidiyah desert  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The easiest place to get into the dessert, you could actually just hike in for a bit, but not too far... it is dangerous.</P>

 <P><B>Wadi Bin Khalid  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is a bit out of your way, this wadi, but it is beautiful and it can be used to start a two day hike up to the coast. Beware not to hike during or just after the rain, it is dangerous.</P>

 <P><B>Sur  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Do not come here, go to the wadis just west of this dull city. It is big and boring. You could go to see the turtle hatch though, a bit more to the east.</P>

 <P><B>Al Hamra  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Al Hamra is the gateway to hiking in the mountains, and maybe the place to buy food and drinks in preparation. Hikes are to the west, north and east of Al Hamra. The town is quite insignificant.</P>

 <P><B>Misfat Al Abriyyin  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small historical town around an oasis, good for having a look around when you are in the region. It is also the start or end of a hike.</P>

 <P><B>Balad Sayt Hike  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This beautiful hike brings you from the top, down to Misfat.</P>

 <P><B>Bahla  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another too nicely restored fort, and not much else.</P>

 <P><B>Wadi Ghul  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A tiny town to start or end the hike from Jebel Shams.</P>

 <P><B>Jebel Shams  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The highest mountain in the region, and a good place for splendid views. It is possible to drive a car up to mountain, but also hikes are possible.</P>

 <P><B>Suwadi Beach  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Here you can find a nice pick-nick spot, at tranquil waters.</P>
