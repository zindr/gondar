	<P><B>Zagreb <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Zagreb has a great vibe to it, reminding me a bit of Berlin albeit being much smaller.</P>
	
	<P><B>Zadar <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This cheap flight destination is quite nice for starting a trip. A relaxed city with a few tourist sites that can keep you going for a day.</P>
	
	<P><B>Plitvice Lakes <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is seemingly the number one tourist site of the country, half a day of nice walks up and around beautiful lakes covered by tourist hurdles for a steep 15 Euro entry ticket.</P>
	
	<P><B>Karlobag <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This is just a small, quit touristy, place on the beautiful coast of Croatia.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gospic <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Getting stuck hitch-hiking... this is just a city on route.</P>
	
	<P><B>Dubrovnik <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Maybe the best tourist city in all of the Balkan, Dubrovnik has an imposing fort swamped by tourists and tourist industry. It is good for hanging out for a day, I guess.</P>
