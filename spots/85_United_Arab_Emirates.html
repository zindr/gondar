<P><B>Dubai  <small>(2014-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Plastic fantastic... be awed by the many skyscrapers and the biggest, the highest, the most... whatever. It is not a backpacking place. Shop, what else really is there to do ?</P>

 <P><B>Sharjah  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>An easy day trip from Dubai, just for having a different taste of the region, but do not expect that there is much to see or do.</P>

 <P><B>Abu Dhabi  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The UAE capital, trying to catch up with Dubai in its growth. It partially owns Dubai. There is a mosque that is worth a visit. Again, no place to backpack.</P>

 <P><B>Al Ain  <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The oasis town near the Oman border. It is boring for most but it has a few things you can visit if you get stuck on the road to or from Oman.</P>
