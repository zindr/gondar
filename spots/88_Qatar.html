	<P><B>Doha <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The capital and almost only real city is a bit like Dubai, grown out of nothing at an excruciating pace. It also tries to be biggest, tallest, longest, ... and for tourist, there is only very little. There is a nice museum.</P>
	
	<P><B>Qatar Desert Trip <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Couchsurfing brought me to do this desert trip with a bunch of locals, interesting for doing ones. At least I can say I saw half of the country, and it took me less than a day.</P>
