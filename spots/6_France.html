	<HR>
<P><B>Castillon-du-Gard  <small>(1991-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>I visited this small town as part of a youth vacation, a rural area with a historic bridge.</P>

 <P><B>Paris  <small>(1992-00)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Famous Paris is the city that shows off, in fact it is maybe the series of ex-presidents that show off instead with the various famous buildings. I recommend Musee d'Orsay.</P>

 <P><B>Versailles  <small>(1992-00)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The city of Versailles is mostly known for its palace, home of Louis XIV. Friends of mine lived nearby.</P>

 <P><B>Nice  <small>(1993-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>My first independent trip (1993), with my girlfriend, was in the south of France, staring in Nice. It was fun, but I would not recommend it to anyway.</P>

 <P><B>Cannes  <small>(1993-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A brief visit to Cannes was OK, but nothing of real interest.</P>

 <P><B>Nimes  <small>(1993-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nimes is just a city in the south of France, nothing of particular interest.</P>

 <P><B>Mont Saint Michel  <small>(1998-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the most famous landmarks in France, Mont Saint Michel is quite imposing.</P>

 <P><B>Saint Brieuc  <small>(1998-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>My visit was part of a wedding, it is a tourist area but not the most popular one.</P>

 <P><B>Mulhouse  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A camping stop was just enough time to have a beer and a walk in the city which is alright.</P>

 <P><B>Colmar  <small>(2020-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A camping stop was just enough time to have a beer, a tarte flambee and a walk in this touristy city which was quite nice.</P>

 <P><B>Lille  <small>(2019-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Once a cultural capital, and OK for a short visit on the road to the coast.</P>

 <P><B>French coast  <small>(2019-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Beautiful stretch of coast to do some walks.</P>

 <P><B>Hondschoote  <small>(2019-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Tiny village near Belgium, just a place to stay the night.</P>

 <P><B>Lourdes  <small>(2024-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A gateway to the Pyrenees, rather than a religious center which was a fun thing to visit.</P>

 <P><B>Gavarnie  <small>(2024-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A first step into the Pyrenees, hiking up to the other side in Spain (near Barjuelo).</P>

 <P><B>Pont dEspagne  <small>(2024-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>From spain the hike down (d'Oussou) and up (Baysaillance) and down (Oulettes) to Pont d'Espagne was great, took 1.5 days.</P>

 <P><B>Cauterets  <small>(2024-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>From Pont d'Espagne up to Refuge Wallon, and col de Fache, and back again, had some great views too, 1.5 days to reach surpisingly nice looking Cauterets boasting grandeur of the past.</P>

 <P><B>Bayonne  <small>(2024-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Some time to spare, but that was OK in one of the bigger cities in th neighborhood.</P>
