	<P><B>Paris <small>(1992-00)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Famous Paris is the city that shows off, in fact it is maybe the series of ex-presidents that show off instead with the various famous buildings. I recommend Musee d`Orsay.</P>
	
	<P><B>Versailles <small>(1992-00)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The city of Versailles is mostly known for its palace, home of Louis XIV. Friends of mine lived nearby.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mont Saint Michel <small>(1998-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>One of the most famous landmarks in France, Mont Saint Michel is quite imposing.</P>
	
	<P><B>Saint Brieuc <small>(1998-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>My visit was part of a wedding, it is a tourist area but not the most popular one.</P>
	
	<P><B>Nice <small>(1993-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>My first independent trip (1993), with my girlfriend, was in the south of France, staring in Nice. It was fun, but I would not recommend it to anyway.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cannes <small>(1993-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A brief visit to Cannes was OK, but nothing of real interest.</P>
	
	<P><B>Nimes <small>(1993-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Nimes is just a city in the south of France, nothing of particular interest.</P>
	
	<P><B>Castillon-du-Gard <small>(1991-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I visited this small town as part of a youth vacation, a rural area with a historic bridge.</P>
