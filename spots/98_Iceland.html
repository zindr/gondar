	<HR>
<P><B>Reykjavik  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Not exactly what you expect from a European capital, but sure there is a street with a lot of places to grab a beer.</P>

 <P><B>Pingvellir  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Breaking Europe away from the Americas, at 2 cm per year. I is a nice thought to stand on it.</P>

 <P><B>Geysir  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Prototypical Iceland, water bursting out of the ground at the famous Geyser, well... a nearby one at least.</P>

 <P><B>Gullfoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the many waterfalls in Iceland, Gullfoss is a nice one.</P>

 <P><B>Kerid Crater Lake  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This crater lake is one of the few things you pay for in Iceland, maybe it is best visited in summer when all colors are there.</P>

 <P><B>Selfoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the slightly bigger places in Iceland, still tiny and boring though. At least here you can get a coffee somewhere, and there is a mall.</P>

 <P><B>Small Waterfall  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Do not go to Iceland for City life, it is almost dead around here, but waterfalls pop up, some really nice. The dirt road further up and down to the ring road was also scenic.</P>

 <P><B>Seljalandfoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Waterfalls also come in various sizes, some are a bit bigger like this one, on the road.</P>

 <P><B>Skogar Foss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Again, a waterfall, also nice, and apparently a place for hiking, for us a place to stay the night.</P>

 <P><B>Dyrholaey  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A very nice black beach view, rocks gazing at you, a very nice stopover to make here and good for a walk up the hill.</P>

 <P><B>Vik  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It should be popular here, but it is another tiny big place, with a black beach.</P>

 <P><B>Kirkjubaejarklauster  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Place-names seem to be bigger than the places, but here is a famous church and some tiny hikes around if you have nothing better to do.</P>

 <P><B>Skaftafel  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This is the popular hiking place, with short and not so short hikes nearby the glacier. It is one of the more interesting places to go on foot.</P>

 <P><B>Jokulsarlon Glacial Lagoon  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A really enchanting place, with ice-rocks drifting away from the glacier towards the ocean. It is amazing how much to see here, on road.</P>

 <P><B>Hofn  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Again a city, with at least a shop and a place to get our flat tire fixed. At the harbor there is a nice view out over the ocean.</P>

 <P><B>Djupvogur  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another city or whatever where you can spent a few minutes. Every town here looks like a vacation village.</P>

 <P><B>Oxi road  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Iceland is a perfect road trip destination, some of the roads are worth it in their own right.</P>

 <P><B>Egilsstadir  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The cities in Iceland, horribly boring.</P>

 <P><B>Seydisfjordur  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Admittedly, there are not all equally bad, this tiny town has its charms and a place to get coffee or grill food.</P>

 <P><B>Jokulsa a Bru  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Sometimes you pass a canyon, quite alright for a pick-nick or so.</P>

 <P><B>Sleepover Snow  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The scenery is amazing, now at the end of May snow is still omnipresent and making it a bit otherworldly, and the sun just never goes away.</P>

 <P><B>Dettifoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The biggest waterfall in Iceland, or in Europe. There is a smaller second part to it, they are nice.</P>

 <P><B>Hverir  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Thermal activity is interesting to see, with mud pools boiling, steam coming from the ground. This is one of the biggest draws for Iceland.</P>

 <P><B>Viti Crater  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A few craters are easy to visit, Viti suggested to be the nicest. Hikes are possible.</P>

 <P><B>Myvatn  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Around Myvatn there are various attractions, including a blue lagoon like swimming pool, a crater, walks through lava fields, pseudo craters, ... undoubtedly one of the best places to visit.</P>

 <P><B>Godafoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>We are already waterfalled out by now, just passing Godafoss on route.</P>

 <P><B>Akureyri  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The second city of Iceland, well, a five coffee bars and I do not know what else.</P>

 <P><B>Sleepover Parking  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Yeey, a parking with a free toilet and water.</P>

 <P><B>Olafsik  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another city, well, village. It reminds me, a lot of the churches are nice and modern looking, also here.</P>

 <P><B>Snaefellsjokul  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>We hoped to go hiking here in this national park but maybe just driving through is sufficient. I loved the scenery, with green moss covered lava remains.</P>

 <P><B>Arnarstapi  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The seaside here is nice between Hellnar and Arnarstapi, with in Hellnar a cave echoing and a nice enough short walk for stretching the legs.</P>

 <P><B>Bogarnes  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Boring... yep, what else can I say, but it is big enough to have a bar and some restaurants.</P>

 <P><B>Deildartunguhver  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another waterfall, alright.</P>

 <P><B>Reykholt  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A small town with some history and a big hotel.</P>

 <P><B>Akranes  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nope, also here there is not much of a reason to come here.</P>
