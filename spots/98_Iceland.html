	<HR>
<P><B>Reykjavik  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Not exactly what you expect from a European capital, but sure there is a street with a lot of places to grab a beer. The second visit, in 2020 during covid was nice, not surrounded by masses of young tourists.</P>

 <P><B>Pingvellir  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Breaking Europe away from the Americas, at 2 cm per year. I is a nice thought to stand on it.</P>

 <P><B>Geysir  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Prototypical Iceland, water bursting out of the ground at the famous Geyser, well... a nearby one at least.</P>

 <P><B>Gullfoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the many waterfalls in Iceland, Gullfoss is a nice one.</P>

 <P><B>Kerid Crater Lake  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This crater lake is one of the few things you pay for in Iceland, maybe it is best visited in summer when all colors are there.</P>

 <P><B>Selfoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the slightly bigger places in Iceland, still tiny and boring though. At least here you can get a coffee somewhere, and there is a mall.</P>

 <P><B>Small Waterfall  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Do not go to Iceland for City life, it is almost dead around here, but waterfalls pop up, some really nice. The dirt road further up and down to the ring road was also scenic.</P>

 <P><B>Seljalandfoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Waterfalls also come in various sizes, some are a bit bigger like this one, on the road.</P>

 <P><B>Skogar Foss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Again, a waterfall, also nice, for us a place to stay the night the first time, the second it was the  start of our hike.</P>

 <P><B>Dyrholaey  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A very nice black beach view, rocks gazing at you, a very nice stopover to make here and good for a walk up the hill.</P>

 <P><B>Vik  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It should be popular here, but it is another tiny big place, with a black beach.</P>

 <P><B>Kirkjubaejarklauster  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Place-names seem to be bigger than the places, but here is a famous church and some tiny hikes around if you have nothing better to do.</P>

 <P><B>Skaftafel  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This is the popular hiking place, with short and not so short hikes nearby the glacier. It is one of the more interesting places to go on foot.</P>

 <P><B>Jokulsarlon Glacial Lagoon  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A really enchanting place, with ice-rocks drifting away from the glacier towards the ocean. It is amazing how much to see here, on road.</P>

 <P><B>Hofn  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Again a city, with at least a shop and a place to get our flat tire fixed. At the harbor there is a nice view out over the ocean.</P>

 <P><B>Djupvogur  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another city or whatever where you can spent a few minutes. Every town here looks like a vacation village.</P>

 <P><B>Oxi road  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Iceland is a perfect road trip destination, some of the roads are worth it in their own right.</P>

 <P><B>Egilsstadir  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The cities in Iceland, horribly boring.</P>

 <P><B>Seydisfjordur  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Admittedly, there are not all equally bad, this tiny town has its charms and a place to get coffee or grill food.</P>

 <P><B>Jokulsa a Bru  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Sometimes you pass a canyon, quite alright for a pick-nick or so.</P>

 <P><B>Sleepover Snow  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The scenery is amazing, now at the end of May snow is still omnipresent and making it a bit otherworldly, and the sun just never goes away.</P>

 <P><B>Dettifoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The biggest waterfall in Iceland, or in Europe. There is a smaller second part to it, they are nice.</P>

 <P><B>Hverir  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Thermal activity is interesting to see, with mud pools boiling, steam coming from the ground. This is one of the biggest draws for Iceland.</P>

 <P><B>Viti Crater  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A few craters are easy to visit, Viti suggested to be the nicest. Hikes are possible.</P>

 <P><B>Myvatn  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Around Myvatn there are various attractions, including a blue lagoon like swimming pool, a crater, walks through lava fields, pseudo craters, ... undoubtedly one of the best places to visit.</P>

 <P><B>Godafoss  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>We are already waterfalled out by now, just passing Godafoss on route.</P>

 <P><B>Akureyri  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The second city of Iceland, well, a five coffee bars and I do not know what else.</P>

 <P><B>Sleepover Parking  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Yeey, a parking with a free toilet and water.</P>

 <P><B>Olafsik  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another city, well, village. It reminds me, a lot of the churches are nice and modern looking, also here.</P>

 <P><B>Snaefellsjokul  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>We hoped to go hiking here in this national park but maybe just driving through is sufficient. I loved the scenery, with green moss covered lava remains.</P>

 <P><B>Arnarstapi  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The seaside here is nice between Hellnar and Arnarstapi, with in Hellnar a cave echoing and a nice enough short walk for stretching the legs.</P>

 <P><B>Bogarnes  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Boring... yep, what else can I say, but it is big enough to have a bar and some restaurants.</P>

 <P><B>Deildartunguhver  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another waterfall, alright.</P>

 <P><B>Reykholt  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A small town with some history and a big hotel.</P>

 <P><B>Akranes  <small>(2015-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nope, also here there is not much of a reason to come here.</P>

 <P><B>Fimmvorduhals  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A 5 hour hike along green pastures and waterfalls, and rocky paths higher up, takes you up to the ridge, lucky to have a clear evening view over the valley around.</P>

 <P><B>Emstrur  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A spectacular 10 hour hike runs down through rocky green mountains to Porsmork, and further through a bit of forest, rivers and desert to out camping site. A super hike, with only a bit of rain in the morning.</P>

 <P><B>Hrafntinnusker  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A spectacular 10 hour hike runs through the desert and up the mountains amidst colourful mountains with geothermal activity all around. The end was the camping, covered with OBIS and allowing for a great view up high.</P>

 <P><B>Landmannalaugar  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A spectacular 5 hour hike through colourful mountains and geothermal activitiy down to the end point of Landmannalaugar. At the camping site, we were lucky to enjoy a rare moment with only a few in the natural hot water pool after our final short day hike up to mountain to catch a final view.</P>

 <P><B>Hveragerdi  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Because the Kjolur hike did not work, covid related, we had to find alternatives. A relaxed day hiking to the natural hot spring was OK.</P>

 <P><B>Vestmannaeyjar  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The little West Man Island offered another hike and a lot of the famous puffins.</P>

 <P><B>Hafnarfjordur  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>On our way west this was just a stop, good enough base for a small hike. </P>

 <P><B>Helgafell  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A small hike, seemingly popular with locals, brought us up the hill to have a nice view of the barren surroundings. On the way back we crossed the botanical forrest, an OK things to do when there already.</P>

 <P><B>Grindavik  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The start of our final hike, going all the way west through the barren vulcanic landscape of the west.</P>

 <P><B>bridge continents  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The bridge that is extended every year runs from one to the other tectonic plate. Nearby we did some wild camping near the small lagoon.</P>

 <P><B>Reykjanes  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The end of our final hike, where we got a ride out, first going to the blue lagoon and further up in the direction of the airport.</P>

 <P><B>Reykjanesbaer  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>At walking distance of the airport, this city offers an actual shopping street, a good alternative to waiting at the airport. </P>

 <P><B>Gardur  <small>(2020-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>What to do in Iceland with just a bit of spare time, go to the local swimming pool, not the blue lagoon but the local one to sit in the hot tubs, ice cold water barrel and steam room, a relaxed and refreshing last few hours. </P>
