	<P><B>San Pedro Sula <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>just a quick stop, apparently this is one of the cities with the most killings in all of the world, mostly gang related. Note that for tourist during day light there is no problem.</P>
	
	<P><B>Comayagua <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nice city centre in a nice little town. It takes little more than a few hours to get the idea.</P>
	
	<P><B>La Esperanza <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A short stop for me... small town... looks a bit boring at first sight, but that is normal in most of central America.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gracias <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Gracias is just a town with a beautiful colonial city centre, a bit smaller than La Esperanza. The scenery during the trip is nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Choluteca <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>a brief stopover... getting in and out of Honduras.</P>
	
	<P><B>Copan Ruinas <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Ancient Maya site, more refined than number one Tikal. The town itself is also worth a visit. </P>
	
	<P><B>Celaque NP <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Cloud forest, once you get high enough. It is a nice piece of forest, but make sure you get your gps with you if you are not with a guide. </P>
	
	<P><B>Tela <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a city, some visit it for the beach but I just thought it was a good stopover with a real touch.</P>
	
	<P><B>La Ceiba <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another city with an ok waterfront, but mainly a gateway to the islands.</P>
	
	<P><B>Utila <small>(2017-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The cheapest place to get your diving certificate, open water. A bunch of young people in for a party. I just got my certificate.</P>
	
	<P><B>Trujillo <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The town has a nice center with some castle ruins, but I guess most people end up here on route to the Mosquitia. It hurts a bit but I eventually did not, too expensive on my own.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tegucigalpa <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Capitals in this part of the world are not the nicest, and maybe this one is even worse. But ok, it is a part of Honduras I do not want to miss. </P>
