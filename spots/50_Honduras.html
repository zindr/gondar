	<P><B>San Pedro Sula <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>just a quick stop, apparently this is one of the cities with the most killings in all of the world, mostly gang related. Note that for tourist during day light there is no problem.</P>
	
	<P><B>Comayagua <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nice city centre in a nice little town. It takes little more than a few hours to get the idea.</P>
	
	<P><B>La Esperanza <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A short stop for me... small town... looks a bit boring at first sight, but that is normal in most of central America.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gracias <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Gracias is just a town with a beautiful city centre and a few houses around it, a bit smaller than La Esperanza. The scenery during the trip is nice and I read somewhere that a few sidetrips for hiking are possible</P>
	
	<P><B>Choluteca <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>a brief stopover... getting in and out of Honduras.</P>
