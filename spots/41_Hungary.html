<P><B>Budapest  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This city has so much to offer and its great value. Maybe see a 2 Euro opera performance, and visit the Parliament for free.</P>

 <P><B>Eger  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Lacking a bit some attractions, but still nice to hang out.</P>

 <P><B>Pecs  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This is yet another nice place, with lively atmosphere.</P>

 <P><B>Szeged  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This student town was nice, but mainly I was there on route to Serbia.</P>
