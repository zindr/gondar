	<P><B>Tirana <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The capital city has a nice vibe to it, maybe not showing many tourist attractions but definitely a must visit as it shows a bit the other side to Albania.</P>
	
	<P><B>Shkoder <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Not much of interest as a city in itself, but OK as a first experience of Albanian atmosphere.</P>
	
	<P><B>Berat <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Considered as a highlight in Albania, it offers a nice citadel/old town up the mountain and some nice alleys to walk around, good for a day.</P>
	
	<P><B>Llogara NP <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This national park offers a few hikes up mountain passes, if you find where they are. A 4 hour hike offered some very nice forest and eventually some beautiful views. A bit more south, the road goes through the beautiful and well known Llogara pass.</P>
	
	<P><B>Vuno <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Tiny little Vuno has been put on the map because of the Shkola hostel and the nearby gorge with its nice secluded beach.</P>
	
	<P><B>Vuno Gorge <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Walkable from Vuno, though olive plantations and shrubs, this secluded beach with its gorge if for many a highlight to Albania.</P>
	
	<P><B>Saranda <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>on route, a big city with beach and hotels.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gjirokaster <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Known for its old town, this city is one of the tourist highlights and offers quite nice strolls up and down the old town hill. It offers a nice day out.</P>
