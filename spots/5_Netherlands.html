	<P><B>Amsterdam <small>(1990-00)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Wandering around in Amsterdam is really enjoyable. Unfortunately, the people are a bit rude. Hostels are very expensive.</P>
	
	<P><B>Maastricht <small>(1990-00)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Maastricht is one of the nicest Dutch cities, with a bit of history and a river cutting through it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sittard <small>(1990-00)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Sittard is just small city, nothing of interest here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Eindhoven <small>(1990-00)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Eindhoven is not a tourist destination, it is much more an industrial city.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tilburg <small>(2013-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Tilburg is not the nicest city. The Loonse Dunes nearby are worth a walk when you are near. We camped in the Chaamse wouds.</P>
	
	<P><B>Arnhem <small>(2011-00)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>My visits were mostly work related, the city does not really offer much of interest but is OK to walk through.</P>
	
	<P><B>Enschede <small>(2011-00)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>My visits were mostly work related, with the nearby Twente University, the city does not really offer much of interest but it is still nice to walk through.</P>
