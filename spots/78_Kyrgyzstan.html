	<P><B>Bishkek <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The capital, with a small city feel to it. The place for some OK food, and maybe a bit extra...</P>
	
	<P><B>Osh <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This city should have been a bit dodgy, no idea why. The market was less interesting than expected, but the time I spent was OK.</P>
	
	<P><B>Karakul <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The tourist spot in the neighborhood, the entry to the surrounding mountains, lakes, hot springs...</P>
	
	<P><B>Ala Kol <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A splendid hike up to a lake at 3500 meters, covering a pass of 3800 meters, with enough snow to glide your way down at one side... really nice experience, not always easy though.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kochkor <small>(2012-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Going to Song-Kul, you will end up here... we did, but too cold already to go up to the lake, so we went on. The town is easy to ignore otherwise.</P>
	
	<P><B>Suusamyr <small>(2012-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A town in the middle of nowhere... just after the Suusamyr valley... beautiful, just passing through.</P>
	
	<P><B>Barskoon <small>(2012-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a village, maybe a place for horse riding... or a place to sleep... for a night.</P>
	
	<P><B>Arslanbob <small>(2012-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another tourist highlight, but sadly it was already too cold to do the main trek... we found a good alternative though... through the forests, it was very nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Jalal Abad <small>(2012-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A quick stop in Jalal Abad.. no reason, at least, being here I can not think of one.</P>
	
	<P><B>Song Kul <small>(2017-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The hike up to Song Kul from Kyzart Pass and ending in Kyzart town was very nice, the lake was alright but not much happening there. When sleeping in the mountains we were surrounded by horses which added to the experience.</P>
