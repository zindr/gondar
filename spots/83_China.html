<P><B>Beijing  <small>(2013-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A layover, a bit too short to visit the wall or the forbidden city but at least it was possible to walk on the Tienanmen square, see the forbidden city from outside and have some nice Chinese food.</P>

 <P><B>Guangzhou  <small>(2013-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A stopover, just enough to get some food and an N12 50 Euro tablet.</P>

 <P><B>Great Wall HuangHua  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>An almost free piece of the wall, for now. I loved it, with virtually no tourists in site.</P>

 <P><B>PingYao  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This small walled historical city is quite nice for a walk through, and if you have no problem paying the high entrance fee you can even get in some of the buildings.</P>

 <P><B>Tianshui  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>No reason to visit this city, as such, but it was alright for the brief time I spent.</P>

 <P><B>Xiahe  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The big monastery, that is why you are here. You can get a glimpse of the inside if you pay for it. The town is not the worst.</P>

 <P><B>Langmusi  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small Langmusi has a fairly beautiful gorge that you can walk through, and maybe a mountain you might want to climb.</P>

 <P><B>DunHuang  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small The sand dunes in the distant and the refreshing terraces on and near the river front, together with good eating options make this town quite pleasant for a stopover. Unfortunate for the very steep 35 Euro entrance fee of the Hotan caves, and the 16 Euro entrance fee for walking on the dunes.</P>

 <P><B>Turpan  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small The town is maybe not the biggest, but the people are friendly accordingly. You can easily get out of town to visit the fairly interesting ruins of the ancient city.</P>

 <P><B>Urumqi  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you want diversity anywhere in China, this is the place, with faces that could just as well be pictured in Turkey, Russia, ... and also nice was how different the modern main streets are with the back alleys a few meters further.</P>

 <P><B>Jiuyuguan  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The reconstructed fortress that signals the main ending point of the wall is the prime site to visit. The city you should probably avoid, it is downright ugly.</P>

 <P><B>ZhangYe  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Instead of hanging around in Jiuyuguan you might want to hop on over here, a much more pleasant city, but still just a Chinese city.</P>

 <P><B>ChengDu  <small>(2014-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just a city, some people love it, I just walked through it.</P>

 <P><B>Tagong  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is a small place, and the scenery around is quite beautiful although I suspect that it will be more beautiful in spring with the green grass covering the high altitude grasslands. It may be hard gasping for air at this altitude, over 4000 meters.</P>

 <P><B>Litang  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another high altitude city,4100 with higher mountains around. The people are just so friendly and nice around here.</P>

 <P><B>DaoCheng  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you are not willing to pay the steep 20 Euro entrance and 15 Euro transport price to Yading a bit more south you may want to skip this dull place. The mountains north and south are quite brilliant for scenery though.</P>

 <P><B>ShangiLa  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>While many say Yading is the better place, this place is famous for its beauty, not so much the half burned down old part of the city but the surrounding area that again are quite pricey.</P>

 <P><B>Tiger Leaping Gorge  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>While Lonely Planet is overly optimistic about this place, it is not that nice and very easy to skip, say other tourists, local and western. The walk is alright, the gorge is nice, but nothing more.</P>

 <P><B>Lijiang  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you are OK with touristy scenes, the very beautiful old city center will charm you, very nice.</P>

 <P><B>Shaxi  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A picturesque old town square, in a non significant village.</P>

 <P><B>Kunming  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Although most cities in China are not really that nice, overcrowded and suffocating, well, this is a somewhat relaxed place liked by locals and westerners.</P>

 <P><B>Wuyuan  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The main town within the area, not of interest.</P>

 <P><B>JiangWan  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just a small two street town with a few historical buildings, in the Wuyuan area.</P>

 <P><B>Xiaoqi  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A small picturesque village in a valley that is OK for a brief visit.</P>

 <P><B>Tunxi  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The city to start a trip to the yellow mountain, or do just like me and just hang out in the nice historical city center.</P>

 <P><B>HangZhou  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Very popular with locals, this may be worth a brief stopover.</P>

 <P><B>Shanghai  <small>(2014-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you want modern china and big time shopping, this is your place. It is quite fun to end a China trip here.</P>
