	<P><B>Nhlangano <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The road up from this tiny city should be scenic, bummer it was raining cats and dogs.</P>
	
	<P><B>Milwane Wildlife Sanctuary <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This popular stopover provides cheap accomodation in the middle of a wildlife reserve. The hippo trail is a nice hike. Nearby Ezulwini, despite being recommended, seems to be a bit too boring.  </P>
	
	<P><B>Mbabane <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A capital, not that there is much out there. It is good enough to have a walk through or to shop. To sleep there are probably better options.</P>
	
	<P><B>Siteki <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Cities in Swaziland you could hardly call cities, just like Siteki they look like a few malls with some people living near it. </P>
	
	<P><B>Hlane NP <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you want to come up close to lions, this zoo-like national park may be for you, otherwise, give it a miss.</P>
	
	<P><B>Malalotja <small>(2016-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Maybe you see some animals on this hike, but you surely will enjoy the hilly hike, and maybe the outdoor camping in the canyon. </P>
