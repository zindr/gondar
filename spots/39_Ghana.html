	<P><B>Accra <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>An African capital... to see the youngsters go out... and the not so youngsters, funny stuff, and an OK city to hang out I guess...</P>
	
	<P><B>Kokrobitey <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A rasta beach resort... go there to chill... smoke weed with the rastas, or drink beer in the guesthouse... In town only one street has more than houses, but most people just spent time on the beach. You can swim here... but beware of pickpockets.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kakum NP <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The only reason to come here is for the 30 meter high suspension bridge (5 Gcd student price) through the rain forest. Animals you will not see, not even if you go the earliest possible. For accommodation you save money in the nearby town: Abrafo Odumase.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cape Coast <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The tourist attraction would probably be the castle (4 Gcd student price, including the guided tour) with its past as being the deportation prison for the slavetrade. And aside of that, it is a nice town in a nice mountainous area.</P>
	
	<P><B>Princess Town <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Small beach town, with a castle where you can sleep (1.5 Gcd outside + 0.2 Gcd entrance). This is a place to get away of it all... smoke some weed and do absolutely nothing... there is nothing to do at this white palm-fringed beach.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kumasi <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The biggest market in Africa, yep, it is big. Not that you would want to buy much, it is off course local market. It is enjoyable here, to say the least... get a taste of red red, or eat bat.</P>
	
	<P><B>Larabanga <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Larabanga is just the town near the Mole NP (2.5 Gcd studentprice), nothing to see or do here. Mole is 6 kilometres further.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mole NP <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Several animal species can be seen here with a guided tour (1.5 Gcd): elephants, small crocodiles, baboons and other monkeys, these ugly pigs... pumba from the lion king, ... and birds of course.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tamale <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a city a bit up north of Ghana, predominantly Muslim, it is OK for a stop-over. When I was there I witnessed Angola - South Africa at the Africa Cup.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bolgatanga <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a town up north... a bit different atmosphere, very nice to wander. Every three days there is a market... and there is some local millet based beer. Also you can eat dog.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tongo <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Beautiful rock scenery just beyond this small town. It is a really nice walk there.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hohoe <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>on my way to Wii</P>
	
	<P><B>Wii waterfall <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The biggest waterfall in West-Africa, still no reason to go there. The area around quite nice though, but hardly worth the entrance fee.</P>
	
	<P><B>Akosombo <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A 36 hour boat trip that leaves on Monday takes you up the Volta from Akosombo, to reach Yeji and a ferry further connects to Makongo.</P>
	
	<P><B>Yeyi <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>waiting... again... it is where you get stuck, not where you want to be.</P>
