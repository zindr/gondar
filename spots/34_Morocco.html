	<HR>
<P><B>Rabat  <small>(2007-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another modern city in contemporary Morocco. The new part has a fresh feel to it, and the old Medina is also nice to hang out... and eat fish kebabs. The tomb is enjoyable, as is the walk up there...</P>

 <P><B>Casablanca  <small>(2007-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A modern city in the north of Africa, I only visited it very briefly but it seemed OK. The Medina at night with a backpack may have been stretching it a bit, but most people were very nice, surprisingly. The huge mosque comes with a huge ticket price too...</P>

 <P><B>Fes  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Here you come to enjoy the Medina, a twirling set of small streets on a hill... very enchanting, and a real taste of old day Morocco city life. In 2019 I made a brief stop again.</P>

 <P><B>Marrakesh  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A beautiful, big and lively square with snakes on music, snails for a snack,40 stands to sell orange juice... but maybe a bit too touristy.</P>

 <P><B>Essaouira  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The beach in a touristy and relaxed town. The rough sea pounding the city walls in winter is a nice sight. </P>

 <P><B>Ouarzazate  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nice scenery, in which this slightly upmarket city in between mountains and desert is located. There is a big film-studio quite near, apparently, and the popular Kasbah.</P>

 <P><B>Taroudant  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Short stop over in this OK city, very normal looking given that it is Morocco.</P>

 <P><B>Tiznit  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just a city, nothing of interest in particular and not particularly charming... but still OK and nice to get into contact with ordinary life.</P>

 <P><B>Tafraoute  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>In the mountains, this is nice for walking... the beautiful hill-side can entertain you for the day. The town itself is enchanting, but also smallish without much of particular interest.</P>

 <P><B>Dakhla  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A beach peninsula, arriving there is brilliant as you drive a sandy plain across the ocean. It is the last stop before Mauritania. For kite lovers, there are many.</P>

 <P><B>Tanger  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A second entry to Morocco, but just the airport to the bus station.</P>

 <P><B>Chefchaouen  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Smokers paradise, so I have been told, or just the blue city. It was nice, this touristy town, and the perfect base to start hiking through the rif mountains.</P>

 <P><B>Akchour  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Local tourists around, many come to hang out in the blue clear river and visit the waterfal. For me, this was the end of a long day hike.</P>

 <P><B>Azilal  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>To get to the countryside often means switching to small buses and waiting for them to fill up, giving enough time to have a taste of just another town.</P>

 <P><B>Ait Bouguemez  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The happy valley, arguably one of the most beautiful valleys of the country. Tabant is good for a few restaurants, stay you can do in one of the various tiny towns nearby. </P>

 <P><B>MGoun  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The non-touristy alternative to Toubkal, the 4100 meter plus mountain is the first step into a brilliant 4 day hike through the valley and gorge.</P>

 <P><B>Kalaat MGouna  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>After the brilliant 4 day hike, this nondescript town was a perfect place to have a relaxing evening. </P>

 <P><B>Tamellalt  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A bit north of Boumalne Dades, there is boulder country, allowing for a very nice hike through and over them. </P>

 <P><B>Tinghir  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just another city, but alright, with a few hostels, so good to hang out to relax briefly. </P>

 <P><B>Ait Benhaddou  <small>(2019-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This strongly remodeled but yet somewhat authentic 11th century kasbah is very touristy, and maybe OK to have a look at. Just another city, but alright, with a few hostels, so good to hang out to relax briefly. </P>
