	<P><B>Rabat <small>(2007-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another modern city in contemporary Morocco. The new part has a fresh feel to it, and the old Medina is also nice to hang out... and eat fish kebabs. The tomb is enjoyable, as is the walk up there...</P>
	
	<P><B>Casablanca <small>(2007-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A modern city in the north of Africa, I only visited it very briefly but it seemed OK. The Medina at night with a backpack may have been stretching it a bit, but most people were very nice, surprisingly. The huge mosque comes with a huge ticket price too...</P>
	
	<P><B>Fes <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Here you come to enjoy the Medina, a twirling set of small streets on a hill... very enchanting, and a real taste of old day Morocco city life.</P>
	
	<P><B>Marrakesh <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A beautiful, big and lively square with snakes on music, snails for a snack, 40 stands to sell orange juice... but maybe a bit too touristy.</P>
	
	<P><B>Essaouira <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The beach in a touristy and relaxed town. The rough sea pounding the city walls is a nice sight. OK for trying out some food.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ouarzazate <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Brilliant surroundings... and a bit of a peculiar atmosphere kinda town. I have not been there more than a number of hours... There is a big film-studio quite near, apparently.</P>
	
	<P><B>Taroudant <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>short stop over in this OK city, very normal looking given that it is Morocco. </P>
	
	<P><B>Tiznit <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a city, nothing of interest in particular and not particularly charming... but still OK and nice to get into contact with ordinary life.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tafraoute <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>In the mountains, this is nice for walking... the beautiful hill-side can entertain you for the day. The town itself, although enchanting, is smallish and has nothing much of particular interest.</P>
	
	<P><B>Walk Tafraoute <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The walk in the beautiful area was nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Dakhla <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A beach peninsula, arriving there is brilliant as you drive a sandy plain across the ocean. It is the last stop before Mauritania. For kite lovers, there are many.</P>
