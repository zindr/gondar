	<P><B>mainland Greece <small>(summer, 1994)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Greece in three weeks was nice at the time to get first traveling experiences, slowly exploring mainly the Pelloponesos.</P>
	
	<P><B>West and Central Turkey <small>(summer, 1995)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A first step towards the east and real traveling, I knew during this month that this was just the beginning when looking towards the east on mount Nimrod.</P>
	
	<P><B>Java and Bali <small>(summer, 1998)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Now I have left Europe, this month was an eye opener. I was not always easy, and I did not like the Balinese attitude towards tourist but I was hooked.</P>
	
	<P><B>Czech Republic <small>(summer, 2000)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>With a few friends to Prague, to spend some of my first earned money.</P>
	
	<P><B>South East Asia <small>(autumn, 2001)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>My first solo trip, the south east asian loop. 100 days, a life changer.</P>
	
	<P><B>Southern Asia <small>(autumn, 2002)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Talking to other tourists, suddenly crossing the whole of southern Asia seemed possible, so I just left with a one way to Istanbul aiming to get back from Burma 4 months later.</P>
	
	<P><B>Eastern Europe cut short <small>(summer, 2004)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Having bought a car for the purpose, I was off to cross the east of Europe towards Italy. Unfortunately our trip was cut short because my car got stolen.</P>
	
	<P><B>Middle East <small>(summer, 2004)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The three week middle east trip extended to linked up set of countries from Indonesia to Turkey.</P>
	
	<P><B>Through East Africa <small>(winter, 2005-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Talking to other tourists, suddenly extending my link of countries further down into Africa seemed possible, a brilliant experience.</P>
	
	<P><B>Through West Africa <small>(winter, 2007-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Having got the taste for Africa, it seemed natural to visit the west like I did the east.</P>
	
	<P><B>Spain <small>(summer, 2008)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>For a congress I had to be in Oviedo, so the perfect time to have a taste of Spain.</P>
	
	<P><B>Central America <small>(winter, 2009-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>120 days I hade to go from Mexico City to Bogota, again a longer trip.</P>
	
	<P><B>Southern Africa <small>(winter, 2010-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>After East and West, time to visit the South of Africa for a few months.</P>
	
	<P><B>South America <small>(winter, 2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>For a big trip, 3 months, options are getting more limited, so time to visit the south of the Americas.</P>
	
	<P><B>Georgia <small>(spring, 2012)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The Caucasus was the next to visit, but because the trip was cut short to two weeks only Georgia I went.</P>
	
	<P><B>Central Asia <small>(summer, 2012)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Not the most straightforward place to visit on a budget, but sometimes you just have to play, and in my case win.</P>
	
	<P><B>The Gulf to South Asia <small>(winter, 2014)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Not really a budget place, but still a place to check out, the Gulf and then it is cheap to finally visit the southern part of India.</P>
	
	<P><B>Madagascar <small>(summer, 2013)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A month is not much time to cover this big slow paced country, but you can.</P>
	
	<P><B>China <small>(winter, 2014)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A month is not much time to cover this big country, but you can.</P>
	
	<P><B>Balkan, west <small>(spring, 2014)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Albania was still in my list, so during these three weeks I could visit that region.</P>
	
	<P><B>Balkan, east <small>(autumn, 2009)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a quick trip in between jobs, these 3 weeks proved very nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Scandinavia, west <small>(summer, 2014)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Despite the expenses, eventually I had a few weeks to go to see Norway.</P>
	
	<P><B>Eastern South East Asia <small>(spring, 2013)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Having avoided the islands before, it was now time to go further east for a few months.</P>
	
	<P><B>West Africa, again <small>(spring, 2015)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Sometimes the price of a plane ticket makes the decision, good for three weeks.</P>
	
	<P><B>Iceland <small>(spring, 2015)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another one of these expensive countries that appeal to the imagination, with only a week to spare.</P>
	
	<P><B>Eastern Europe, north <small>(spring, 2010)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Why go very far, some countries nearby are really interesting too to spend a few weeks.</P>
	
	<P><B>Eastern Europe, north again <small>(spring, 2012)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Ukraine I wanted to visit again, and with a few weeks to spare I could include Romania to get them all.</P>
	
	<P><B>Dolomites, Italy <small>(spring, 2015)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you like walking, this is a very nice area to spend a week or so.</P>
	
	<P><B>Poland <small>(spring, 2013)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>These days it is cheap traveling by plane, if you have only a long weekend.</P>
	
	<P><B>Scandinavia, north <small>(summer, 2015)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Having got the taste for road trips in the north, Norway it was again.</P>
