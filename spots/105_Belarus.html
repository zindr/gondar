<P><B>Minsk  <small>(2017-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Surprisingly stylish, the capital boasts the finest of Soviet architecture and even a bit of coziness. Lucky for me the weather turned to the best and all of Minsk was celebrating the 950th birthday.</P>

 <P><B>Viciebsk  <small>(2017-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A lot smaller than Minsk but in itself very nice. It is a great alternative view on Belarussian city life.</P>

 <P><B>Polatsk  <small>(2017-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It gets even smaller here, but for a few hours this town is perfect.</P>

 <P><B>Brest  <small>(2017-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>I may have spent just a bit too little time in attractive Brest to get the full experience, I enjoyed it.</P>

 <P><B>Kamianiuki  <small>(2017-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you do not speak the language, prepare yourself before going to the Bielaviezskaja Pusca national park, I think I kinda missed most of what is out there. I did do a small hike and saw the bison, caged.</P>
