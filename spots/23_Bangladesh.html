	<P><B>Dhaka <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Overcrowded, rough, poor and interesting, definitely worth a peak but it is clear why you do not see tourists. I was there in the middle of Ramadan but no particular problems with that.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chittagong <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I was only here briefly, with its curious and friendly people and a nice and vivid late night market.</P>
	
	<P><B>Rangamati <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I was also here only shortly, tourists were not allowed to be on their own following a kidnapping a few years before. But people there treated me again very nice and I had some interesting time up there in Rangamati.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mongla <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Gateway to the Sundarbans national park, this tiny little town is just that.</P>
