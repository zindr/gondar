<P><B>Sydney  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>My first intro to Australia really was a success, really enjoying walking around the different colorful and diverse neighborhoods of Downtown, Newtown, Bondee, ... loved it.</P>

 <P><B>Blue Mountains  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you have the time and like a hike, going into the Blue Mountains will be nice, starting from the enjoyable Katoomba, I liked the hikes to the Ruined Castle and Grand Canyon, especially the views.</P>

 <P><B>Hobart  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The capital of Tasmania is nice, but small. It is put on the map by the very very interesting museum MONA and you will find enough to do for two days.</P>

 <P><B>Maria Island  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>By many considered the very best place to visit in Tasmania, this island offers a hike up the mountains, wildlife and simply very nice scenery.</P>

 <P><B>Freycinet  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A second highlight, this peninsula, is nice for it's hike up to a viewpoint and I liked the solitary walk on the beach.</P>

 <P><B>Deloraine  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Very small, but what a nice surprise ending up there in the midday sun, I loved it, it's setting, it's building, it's tourist information office. </P>

 <P><B>Walls of Jerusalem NP  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The alternative to the Overland Trek, free, shorter and a bit less diverse, but mostly considered a very good alternative, this hike up to alpine landscapes, this 2 day hike was really worth it.</P>

 <P><B>Cradle Moutain NP  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The start of the Overland Trek is beautiful in itself, you do have to share it with loads of tourists but early morning is good for a hike up. Also this day hike was really worth it.</P>

 <P><B>Bicheno  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Most towns I saw in Tasmania are small and boring, here I put my tent on the beach because I got stuck, public transport is a mess in this part of the world.</P>

 <P><B>Bay of Fires NP  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Near St. Helens the Bay of Fires is a very popular tourist getaway, for campers to spend a few days. The beach is beautiful, with it's red rocks, but I would not spent too much time here.</P>

 <P><B>Launceston  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Quite missable, the second city of Tasmania, but OK for shopping, and you might want to stroll up the gorge. Most memorable for me was the capsule hostel.</P>

 <P><B>Evandale  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>To avoid expensive transport to the airport, a bus to nearby Evandale may be an option. It is definetely not as interesting as described in Lonely Planet though, you can miss it.</P>

 <P><B>Great Ocean Road  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Luckily it is possible to get a quick view on the ocean road by public bus, happy to have seen it because so iconic, but otherwise it is mostly just beautiful coastline. The Twelve Apostels are probably the most famous.</P>

 <P><B>Saint Kilda  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The beach nearby Melbourne you find in backpacker's town Saint Kilda. It is OK for a quick visit, and a nice alternative perspective to Melbourne if you have the time.</P>

 <P><B>Melbourne  <small>(2024-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The city itself is very nice, with trendy areas, lot's of eateries, musea... I enjoyed the areas near Flinders, Victoria, Fitzroy, which all offered their own vibe.</P>
