<P><B>Kampala  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Relaxed and safe even after dark with free Monday cultural performances in the National Theater. There is not all that much to do or see but it is nice to hang out for a few days.</P>

 <P><B>Jinja  <small>(2006-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Jinja, where the Nile originates, is now a place for rafting and bungee jumping, both expensive. The town is OK for a day to get a feel for it.</P>

 <P><B>Masindi  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just a stopover to the national park, half a day of waiting for the park rangers.</P>

 <P><B>Murchison Falls NP  <small>(2006-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The boat trip at the national park I liked a lot, and also I enjoyed the walk up to the falls. I skipped the game drives. Also very nice was the nearby town where the rangers live, with very cheap food and very friendly people.</P>

 <P><B>Ssese Islands  <small>(2006-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is beautiful out there, and I especially enjoyed being on my own in the little stretch of jungle. Beware for Bilharzia in Victoria Lake. For people that enjoy idyllic islands, this is maybe for you, but not for me.</P>

 <P><B>Kabale  <small>(2006-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Surrounded by lush and beautiful scenery, the small city is kinda nice to hang out. Although not much can keep you here. I walked up to the nearby lake keeping me busy for a day. And the walk is OK.</P>

 <P><B>Bognyonyi Walk  <small>(2006-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A walk up to the lake was OK, just for doing something.</P>

 <P><B>Kisoro  <small>(2006-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small town near the Mahinga National Park, not much else to do.</P>

 <P><B>Mahinga  <small>(2006-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A hike up the crater with interesting flora and view up to 4000 meter, a bummer the fog ruined the view into Rwanda and for the hefty price of 30 Euro.</P>

 <P><B>Mahingha Hike  <small>(2006-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It was a nice walk up to the Mahingha mountain.</P>
