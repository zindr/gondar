	<P><B>Ouagadougou <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>An African city most people enjoy... fitting African stereotypes, slums in some parts and trying to be upmarket in other parts. Just hang out there would do for a couple of days. There was one budget option for sleeping, at walking distance from the airport.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ouahigouya <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>stop over after crossing the border</P>
	
	<P><B>Bobo-Dioulasso <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another very nice African town... with dusty roads and a lot of activity. There is a Sudanese built mosque and an interesting looking train station and market. And city life hear can offer an OK nights out.</P>
	
	<P><B>Banfora <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Maybe you do not want to hang out for too long. Nice people but small and nothing of interest in itself. The surroundings are very nice though.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tengrela <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Postcard moments on my way walking to tiny little Tengrela, really, superb nature, rural life, ... </P>
	
	<P><B>Po <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Insignificant town on the road to Ghana. Some people make it to nearby Tiebele with its traditional houses and culture life.</P>
