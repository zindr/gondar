<P><B>Sofia  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This capital ok, but nothing more. I enjoyed going out here.</P>

 <P><B>Plovdiv  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Very nice center, and there are a few things you can visit but it will not take you long to get through.</P>

 <P><B>Veliko Tarnuvo  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe the nicest city to visit here, perched on a hill. There is not very much to keep you busy though.</P>

 <P><B>Rila Monastery  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the tourist draws is this monastery, which really is a bit interesting.</P>

 <P><B>Bansko  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A ski resort in winter, very touristy, a hiker's base in summer... I did 2 day hikes, to the unsettling Koncheto Ridge and very popular Vihren Peak, and I also very much enjoyed a smaller trip to nearby lakes.</P>

 <P><B>Varna  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Rivaling Burgas, this city the the gateway from the black sea, OK enough to wander.</P>

 <P><B>Slanchevo  <small>(2022-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Gateway to small Pobitite Kamani, the stone forest, is apparently a real attraction, not sure what to think of it.</P>
