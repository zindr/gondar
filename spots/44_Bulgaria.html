<P><B>Sofia  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This capital ok, but nothing more. I enjoyed going out here.</P>

 <P><B>Plovdiv  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Very nice center, and there are a few things you can visit but it will not take you long to get through.</P>

 <P><B>Veliko Tarnuvo  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe the nicest city to visit here, perched on a hill. There is not very much to keep you busy though.</P>

 <P><B>Rila Monastery  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the tourist draws is this monastery, which really is a bit interesting.</P>

 <P><B>Bansko  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A ski resort in winter, there is maybe not enough to do in summer... maybe there are some hikes, in that area at least there are some.</P>
