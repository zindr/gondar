	<P><B>Delhi <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Some areas are beautiful, where the embassies are and the palace area, and it is an interesting place. The people treat you like shit, all the time being lied to. With that in mind, stay there for a day or two.</P>
	
	<P><B>Amritsar <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Home of the golden temple of the Sikhs, do not miss it if you are near. The atmosphere is strangely relaxing and just being there is rewarding as it is. Sleep near the temple, get free meals and just sit there and watch the people...</P>
	
	<P><B>Jodhpur <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a city, with a beautiful fort and comparatively nice people.</P>
	
	<P><B>Pushkar <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The holy city was very relaxed and most tourists just sit there drinking bang or other lassies. Again, people are not so nice, always looking to rip you off.</P>
	
	<P><B>Jaisailmer <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Do not go there for the city, but for the fort or for doing a camel trek in the Thar desert. People treat you like shit. </P>
	
	<P><B>3 day camel ride <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The desert is mostly rocks, with a small sandy exception. You see of few tiny villages along the way. Note that a guide will walk near you on your camel. It was ok.</P>
	
	<P><B>Agra (Taj Mahal) <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Home of the Taj Mahal, unfortunately with an extremely high entrance fee of almost 20 US. The city I largely skipped, just like the Agra Fort which otherwise would also have been expensive.</P>
	
	<P><B>Varanasi <small>(2002-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The religious capital of India, at the Ganges. It is an interesting place with so much happening, you see people getting cremated, bathing, ceremonies of different kinds, and a vivid market... It is hard to miss out on this city if you are in India. But the people again treat you like shit.</P>
	
	<P><B>Darjeeling <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Beautifully located but surprisingly polluted by exhaustion fumes, this city offers the nice and relaxed Nepalese atmosphere. There are some hiking possibilities, tea plantations to trek through and finally you can descend with a miniature train.</P>
	
	<P><B>3 day hike <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A 3 day trek crosses in and out of Nepal, on the ridge of the mountain, beautiful scenery. The atmosphere was much more Nepali than Indian. </P>
	
	<P><B>Kolkata <small>(2002-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This English yellow cab city is very nice, and even the people are nice. The poverty is quite shocking sometimes. </P>
	
	<P><B>Puri <small>(2002-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A dirty beach with rough water, and costly temples... so, I would not visit it. </P>
	
	<P><B>Kochi <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A relaxed tourist town, with a few minor attractions. Many tourists start their backwater trip from here. The waterfront is nice to hang out, especially in the evenings.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ernakulam <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The city near touristy Kochi, fairly OK to hang out.</P>
	
	<P><B>Alleppey <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another city where tourists start their backwater trip or where they take a boat to other towns upriver. The city is nice, with its canals.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kollam <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A boring city that offers boat trips around a tiny island, quite boring as well.</P>
	
	<P><B>Munnar <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Beautiful tea plantations surround this small insignificant city. The ride to/from is also very nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ooty <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another hill station others are enthusiastic about, with some tea plantations not too far away.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sultan Bathery <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This simple city is the gateway for the nearby Wayanad wildlife park, I heard that there is actually some wildlife, but I did not see it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mysore <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A beautiful palace in an OK city, it is a perfect place to take a break for a day and have a beer somewhere.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hampi <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Hampi is a tourist settlement that is the gateway to some famous temples in a beautiful environment, a highlight. It easily keeps you walking for a full day, or more. The nearby city, Hospet, is just a city.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bangalore <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I liked this diverse city, colourful, relaxed, ... and if you really want there are a few things you could do or visit.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kodaikanal <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another hill town, nice but not that interesting I guess. The walks were not too bad.</P>
	
	<P><B>Trichy <small>(2014-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another city with very nice old imposing temples. The city was not that interesting, but there were a few sites to visit.</P>
	
	<P><B>Thanjavur <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is just a city, with a few nice temples, one of which is up the hill offering an OK view. </P>
	
	<P><B>Madurai <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is quite a city, and it has remarkable temples. So it is a very good place to take a break for a day or two.</P>
	
	<P><B>Varkalla <small>(2014-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A cliff and a beach, a beautiful spot to do nothing.</P>
