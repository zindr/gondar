	<P><B>Kuala Lumpur <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The capital is quite nice with its diversity, but many tourist attractions there are not and it is also not so easy to get around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Melaka <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This colonial city has some interesting buildings but mainly it has a port towards Indonesia. It is nice to walk around because of its mix of colonial influences.</P>
	
	<P><B>Georgetown <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Stopover, for taking the train to Bangkok</P>
	
	<P><B>Penang <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another nice colonial city with some remarkable colonial buildings and an interesting Indian and Chinese area.</P>
	
	<P><B>local longhouse <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P></P>
	
	<P><B>Niah Caves National Park <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you have never seen caves, these are going to be a nice experience... for me the small walk up there was nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>gas station <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P></P>
	
	<P><B>Sibu <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A day trip to Sibu on my way down to Kuching, OK at least for a day...</P>
	
	<P><B>Kuching <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>They say this is the nicest town for tourist on all of Sarawak. I guess that may be true, not that there is much here... but at least there is something to do in the region and it offers all the amenities.</P>
	
	<P><B>Baku National Park <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Two days of walking around, and seeing some proboscis monkeys... it is a nice national park.</P>
	
	<P><B>Semenggoh Wildlife centre <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>go and see the oran utans... there are many around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kampung Benuk <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A longhouse, or at least the tiny little bit that is still left over after all those years.</P>
