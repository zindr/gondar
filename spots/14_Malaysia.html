<P><B>Kuala Lumpur  <small>(2013-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The capital is quite nice with its diversity, but many tourist attractions there are not and it is a busy place to try and get around. Off course, the second time I was there, during Covid-19 lockdown, getting around was easy when you were still alowed to go out at least.</P>

 <P><B>Melaka  <small>(2001-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This colonial city has some interesting buildings but mainly it has a port towards Indonesia. It is nice to walk around because of its mix of colonial influences.</P>

 <P><B>Georgetown  <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Stopover, for taking the train to Bangkok</P>

 <P><B>Penang  <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another nice colonial city with some remarkable colonial buildings and an interesting Indian and Chinese area.</P>

 <P><B>local longhouse  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>NA</P>

 <P><B>Niah Caves National Park  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you have never seen caves, these are going to be a nice experience... for me the small walk up there was nice.</P>

 <P><B>gas station  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>NA</P>

 <P><B>Sibu  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A day trip to Sibu on my way down to Kuching, OK at least for a day...</P>

 <P><B>Kuching  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>They say this is the nicest town for tourist on all of Sarawak. I guess that may be true, not that there is much here... but at least there is something to do in the region and it offers all the amenities.</P>

 <P><B>Baku National Park  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Two days of walking around, and seeing some proboscis monkeys... it is a nice national park.</P>

 <P><B>Semenggoh Wildlife centre  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>go and see the oran utans... there are many around.</P>

 <P><B>Kampung Benuk  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A longhouse, or at least the tiny little bit that is still left over after all those years.</P>

 <P><B>Kota Bharu  <small>(2020-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This city is a fine place to enter Malaysia, not much to do but relaxed and all the amenities are there. From here you can take the train south to the jungle if you want.</P>

 <P><B>Jerantut  <small>(2020-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The gateway to the Taman Negara National Park appears OK, bordering the jungle. I just went in and out to get to the park.</P>

 <P><B>Taman Negara NP  <small>(2020-03)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Bordering tiny Kuala Tahan the oldest and most famous national park of Malaysia can be found, a fun place to hike for a few days. You can DIY but it is not the most adventurous hike, altough you might run into a Tapir if you are more lucky than I was.</P>
