	<P><B>Dushanbe <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A cosy and tiny capital, but a bit dull too. Luckily I could stay couchsurfing because prices here are not so tiny.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ayni <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a stopover, but interesting to see how small cities are around here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Istaravshan <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>There is not so much here, but it still was nice to hang around... people were very nice too, I like most of them, but not all</P>
	
	<P><B>Khujand <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A big city near the border... entering there at night, not so much fun, lucky for the great help I got from some locals that contrasted heavily with the usual taxi driver asshole mentality.</P>
	
	<P><B>Khorog <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Khorog, the tiny capital of the Pamir, a university city. At the time it was of limits to tourists but with a small bribe here and there I got through.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ishkashim <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Tasting Afghanistan in the Wakhan Valley, while the town was very small, again, the people were hospitable and nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>fortress remains <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Do not get here to see the remains of the fort, that would be the wrong reason unless you are an expert in that area.</P>
	
	<P><B>Murgab <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The middle of nothing... and in nothing you can hike your boots off... going up to 4730 meter... across beautiful scenery... well.. really really cool and beyond... One of my all time highlights.</P>
