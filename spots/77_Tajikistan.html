	<P><B>Dushanbe <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A cosy and tiny capital, but a bit dull too. Luckily I could stay couchsurfing because prices here are were so tiny. A few years later the city was already substantially bigger, and so was the hostel industry. Nice enough city to hang out for a day.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ayni <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a stopover, but interesting to see how small cities are around here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Istaravshan <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>There is not so much here, but it still was nice to hang around... people were very nice too, I like most of them, but not all.</P>
	
	<P><B>Khujand <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A big city near the border... entering there at night, not so much fun, lucky for the great help I got from some locals that contrasted heavily with the usual taxi driver asshole mentality. On a second trip we were invited to stay at someones place, in the center, very nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Khorog <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Khorog, the tiny capital of the Pamir, a university city. At the time I was there the first time it was off limits to tourists but with a small bribe here and there I got through. Beyond the city, everything gets even much smaller.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ishkashim <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Tasting Afghanistan in the Wakhan Valley, while the town was very small, again, the people were hospitable and nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>fortress remains <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Do not get here to see the remains of the fort, that would be the wrong reason unless you are an expert in that area.</P>
	
	<P><B>Murghab <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The middle of nothing... this city, aheum, this is it, when you are on your way through the Pamir. There is nothing here, accept beautiful scenery.</P>
	
	<P><B>Gumbezkul pass <small>(2012-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>In the middle of nothing... you can go hiking... going up to 4730 meter... across beautiful scenery... well.. really really cool and beyond... One of my all time highlights. The second visit I did not hike up but I went there to stay in the yurt, standing with two feet in their daily lives.</P>
	
	<P><B>Isfara <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just passing through, but this border city appears quite nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Rudaki <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>No idea what the name is, but there is a shrine for the philosopher Rudaki. We just stayed the night in this tiny town, not the nicest, they like tourist dollars.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kulikalon Lake <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A beautiful lake is the first stop on our hike, a very nice reward after a steep hike up.</P>
	
	<P><B>Allaudin Lake <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another beautiful lake is a next stop on our hike, amazing colors.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mutnoye Lake <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Not a beautiful lake but the next stop if you are going to go further up the Kaznok or elsewhere.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kaznok Pass <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>At 4040 meter you can cross the Kaznok pass, well, maybe, we get as high of 4020 but had to turn back. So we did not make it to Iskenderkul.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sarvoda <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The entry and exit point to the Fann Mountains, just a parking lot, in a way, a place to catch transport north or south.</P>
	
	<P><B>Zong <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>In the beautiful Wakhan there are some hikes and a few sites, this tiny town is a starting place for one of them.</P>
	
	<P><B>Zong hike <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>An OK hike in the beautiful Wakhan with far views on the Hindu Kush in Pakistan and Afghanistan, going up to sleep at 4000 meter with a view at Peak Marx.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bibi Fatima <small>(2017-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A hot water source and the remains of Yamchun Fort, with beautiful scenery around.</P>
	
	<P><B>Alichur <small>(2017-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Depressing, the cities in the Pamir. While one of the bigger places, it is just a set of houses, no green, dirty, disorganized, ...</P>
	
	<P><B>Ak-Tal <small>(2017-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This tiny tiny little town used to be the entrance to a hot spring, but the hot spring apparently is gone. It was a long hike back, but very beautiful.</P>
