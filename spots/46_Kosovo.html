	<P><B>Pristina <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I loved my visit, it was not nice but a bit surreal to find it in Europe. It was not yet designed for any type of tourism.</P>
	
	<P><B>Prizren <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This lovely town with its charming bridge and nice people was great for a half day side trip.</P>

	<P>At the foot of the accursed mountains, this is actually a nice city to hang out and have a beer, there is even a beach.</P>
	
	<P><B>Accursed Mountains <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A first day hiking towards Albania brings you from Kuqishte almost all the way to the border. It was a nice hike, fairly diverse and not too difficult.</P>
