	<P><B>Amman <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This is just a city, nothing more. The theatre and citadel you can easily skip. This city can be used to visit Jerash, the Dead Sea, ...</P>
	
	<P><B>Dead Sea <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Float around in the Dead Sea, just beyond the secluded and paid areas you can mix with the locals.Bring bottles of water to wash yourself after, the salt on your body is not too nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Aqaba <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This is a tourist town, a bit boring for sure. Personally I do not now why as there is not much of interest here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Wadi Rum <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This peculiar piece of desert, dotted with huge rocky mountains, offers brilliant scenery when you wake up in the early morning, seen from your bed in a bedouin tent. And it is brilliant just walking around in it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Petra <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you like only few ruins, then this one you should probably visit. This is partly because of the temples and tombs, but even more so because of scenery, and partly because of its charm and grandeur, It will take you at least one full day, from early morning to closing time, to cover the most interesting parts. Best spread it over two days.</P>
	
	<P><B>Al Karak <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The crusader castle of Al Karak is fairly boring.</P>
	
	<P><B>Jerash <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>In the centre of Jerash you can visit the nice Roman remains.</P>
