<P><B>Amman  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This is just a city, nothing more. The theater and citadel you can easily skip. This city can be used to visit Jerash, the Dead Sea, ... Also this city got hip in Rainbow street, for example.</P>

 <P><B>Dead Sea  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Float around in the Dead Sea, just beyond the secluded and paid areas you can mix with the locals.Bring bottles of water to wash yourself after, the salt on your body is not too nice.</P>

 <P><B>Aqaba  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This is a tourist town, a bit boring for sure but also more hip and trendy more recently. It is a place to go diving, a bit south of town.</P>

 <P><B>Wadi Rum  <small>(2023-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This peculiar piece of desert, dotted with huge rocky mountains, offers brilliant scenery when you wake up in the early morning, seen from your bed in a Bedouin tent, or from your own tent in the middle of nowhere. And it is brilliant just walking around in it.</P>

 <P><B>Petra  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>If you like only few ruins, then this one you should probably visit. This is partly because of the temples and tombs, but even more so because of scenery, and partly because of its charm and grandeur, It will take you at least one full day, from early morning to closing time, to cover the most interesting parts. Best spread it over two days.</P>

 <P><B>Al Karak  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The crusader castle of Al Karak is fairly boring.</P>

 <P><B>Jerash  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>In the center of Jerash you can visit the nice Roman remains.</P>

 <P><B>Dana  <small>(2022-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The starting point of my hike, tiny tourist town Dana offers only beautiful scenery.</P>

 <P><B>Wadi Barwas  <small>(2022-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Down the mountain, you can pretty much sleep anywhere, but at Barwas someone put in the effort to clear a few square meters.</P>

 <P><B>Ras Al Feyd  <small>(2022-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The second day of the hike is brilliant, for its scenery and because passnig the refreshing Wadi.</P>

 <P><B>Little Petra  <small>(2022-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The third day of the hike is not as great, but still, you should be able to reach little Petra and give it a look, I spent some time with Bedouins instead.</P>
