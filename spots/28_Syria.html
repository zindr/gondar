<P><B>Damascus  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This was a nice city at the time, with its diverse old town. First you will see the souq before ending up at a big Umayad mosque. Wander around an see the Christian quarter side by side with the Muslim quarter. Even the new city I found to be OK. And here you can go to the national museum that was OK.</P>

 <P><B>Homs  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>In Homs I made a stop over to visit the Crac des Chevaliers. While the center of the fighting in the war, before it was a nice but ordinary city.</P>

 <P><B>Crac de Chevaliers  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This castle is interesting showing western heritage, but clearly there are more spectacular castles spread out over Europe.</P>

 <P><B>Hamah  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This was a nice little city. Nearby you can visit beehive houses like they were built in the old days. And it can be an interesting base to visit other places, including the Crac Des Chevaliers, Apamea, Dead Cities...</P>

 <P><B>Palmyra  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Here is the main Syrian site. The main temple is fronted with a nice area in ruins and takes about 30 minutes, maybe three hours for everything. There is also a castly you could hike, preferable in late afternoon, foremost to see the surroundings from a height.</P>

 <P><B>Deir Es Zur  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>To have a glimpse of the part more east, a trip to this city may be interesting although there is nothing of particular interest. As a student I could escape very cheap in the museum. Still, a fun place to be.</P>

 <P><B>Aleppo  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Aleppo was surely a nice city. There are still many very friendly people. And there is a nice citadel you can go to. Or spent some time in the souq shopping. This city is also a good base to visit nearby sites like QaLaat Seman.</P>

 <P><B>Serjilla (Dead Cities)  <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>At the back of a motorcycle with some local guys, just driving round to visit the ruins and to enjoy the Syrian countryside.</P>
