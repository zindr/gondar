	<P><B>Bamako <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The capital has a nice typical African city feel to it. Low rise buildings with lots of activity on the streets, a lot of sandy roads and dust. There are some markets of which one sells everything going from monkey penises to human skulls.... voodoo people.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kayes <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Nothing of particular interest in this town, although it is OK for being a day in between Senegal and Bamako.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sevare <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nearby alternative to Mopti, a bit less over touristed.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mopti <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The Venice of Africa is where you take the boat to Timbuktu. For the boat to Timbuktu I paid 12.5 Euro after bargaining really hard (and friendly), while other tourists on the same boat paid 25 Euro and 50 Euro for the same thing.</P>
	
	<P><B>Kouriome <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Avoid it as much as you can. It is poor, people have nothing to do and they know tourists. </P>
	
	<P><B>Timbuktu <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Timbuktu is a name, it is a myth... it is also an ordinary dusty sandy town near the desert. I am happy the boat trip up there was so brilliant otherwise I may have been dissappointed, but nevertheless, it is Timbuktu and I have been there.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bandiagara <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The small town of Bandiagara, at the verge of the Dogon Valley, is kinda nice and OK for hanging out a day although having nothing of interest.</P>
	
	<P><B>Dogon Valley <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The valley is a story in itself, and a highlight in Mali if you love nature or culture. But, prepare yourself for a touristed crappy few days. I enjoyed my rush through trip, especially because of the scenery and the walk (without guide, although many people say that it is impossible).</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike Dogon Valley <small>(2008-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A two day hike through the valley on my own ended up being really nice.</P>
