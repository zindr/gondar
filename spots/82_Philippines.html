	<HR>

	<P><B>Manila <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The capital is crowded, noisy, dirty... everything you would expect from a capital this part of the world. You can probably find most you would need to find over here, and lots you do not want. I liked it though.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cebu <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Fly in, bus out... I heard that nearby it should be possible to swim with whales, I saw some amazing pictures.</P>
	
	<P><B>Dumaguette <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This tourist town is a nice intro in the Philippines, but do not expect wild parties and lively street animation though.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sibulan <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A small town with a small port, no reason to stay here.</P>
	
	<P><B>Twin Lakes <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just two neighbouring lakes, maybe OK if it were not for the rain. At least the walk up there was nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tagbilaran <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A bit of a rough city but with nice people, just like everywhere else in Bohol. I liked it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tarsier Zoo <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you have not yet seen the Tarsier monkeys, here is your shot at it. </P>
	
	<P><B>Loay <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>On route to the Bohol Chocolat Hills, this small city you may end up in.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bilar <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Lucky for us it was a fiesta here, boring but at least with some free food and loud music. </P>
	
	<P><B>Bilar National Park <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The national park has some poorly marked trails and was OK for a short hike though the jungle. You can put up a tent there. The swimming pool is just that... good for local youngsters. </P>
	
	<P><B>Chocolat Hills <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Famous, a bunch of hills. If you are around, you should not miss it, but in the end, they are just a bunch of hills.</P>
	
	<P><B>Jagna <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Get in and get out... this port serves Camiguin.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mambajao <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Again a bit a rough city, but OK for a night or two if you are OK with going to bed early.</P>
	
	<P><B>White island <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Fun for a bit of snorkelling or the experience to sit on the tiniest of islands, not too spectacular but what else to do. And ok, some of the fish was nice to encounter.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sunken cemetery <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Well, you can see a cross here... if you snorkel you may see a bit more, but, nobody seems to do so.</P>
	
	<P><B>Anda <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is a beach, a fairly white one... and it is public... so, if you are into beaches... note that you can go a long long way before you need to swim.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ubay <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>There are worse port towns, but it is probably not really on your itinerary to stay in this place.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tacloban <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>For a city feel in this part of the Philippines, this probably would do. Samar and Leyte are not major tourist draws, that is clear.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bassey <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>On your way to the Sohoton Caves ? Here you will pay your entry and book a tour. The town is small and insignificant.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sohoton National Park <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The boat trip is nice, the caves... they are caves... and there is a natural bridge near which it is fun for a swim. It is just a day out to do something.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sagada <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A tourist crap town, good if you are into smoking weed or if you crave for cave... but towns with more guesthouses than people, it would seem, are not that interesting</P>
	
	<P><B>Bontoc <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Why was I here... to escape Sagada, probably... but this place lacks the friendliness of the south, service is very poor and options limited...</P>
	
	<P><B>Banaue <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The town itself is just a small tourist town... but the neighbouring rice terraces, that is why you come out here... all the way from Manila.</P>
	
	<P><B>Banaue Ricefields Hike <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A 2 day hike over Pula - Batad was simply brilliant.</P>
	
	<P><B>Pula <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The villages on the hike are tiny tiny. desolate small places surrounded by rice terraces. This was the first village on a superb hike through rice terraces, and forests tracks.</P>
	
	<P><B>Batad <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Famous for its rice terraces that make it appear to be an amphitheatre, and it has a waterfall where some swim. This was almost the end of a superb hike.</P>
	
	<P><B>El Nido <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This is the tourist highlight of Palawan, maybe of the Philippines, only if you like snorkeling and island hopping.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tay Tay <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Few people visit this place, and that is kinda normal I guess. It is an insignificant town.</P>
	
	<P><B>San Vicente <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The longest beach... 14 kilometre of white... well, grey, sand... you can camp there, although I hear in the afternoon there are sandflies... The town, hmmm...</P>
	
	<P><B>Port Barton <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you did not get enough of the island hopping in El Nido, here are some more... not quite the same but still... The town... there is really nothing there... well, there is a small hike in the forest.</P>
	
	<P><B>Puerto Princessa <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The regional capital of Palawan... if it is city you want, coming from Port Barton or elsewhere on Palawan then you are in for a treat... but it is still a long long way from Manila.</P>
