<P><B>Prague  <small>(2000-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The center is really beautiful, but also overly crowded.</P>

 <P><B>Kutna Hora  <small>(2000-09)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The first time ending up here on a Sunday without preparation, it was just another side to Czechia. The second time, I had a better look, the bone church was ok, the gothic church too.</P>

 <P><B>Olomouc  <small>(2010-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This student city is actually quite nice, with a museum and some nice bars to hang out.</P>

 <P><B>Cesky Krumlov  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The most recommended alternative to prague, this small city is realy nice. You will find many locals with a kano on the water, often with navy t-shirt.</P>

 <P><B>Telc  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Tiny city that is good for just a stopover.</P>

 <P><B>Cesky Raj  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Lucky to find at least a few restaurants and a real drinking spot, to avoid spending the whole evening at the campsite.</P>

 <P><B>Adrspach-Teplice Rocks  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Famous rock formations, good for a few hours hiking, more if you have to time.</P>

 <P><B>Vrchlabi  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just a town, near a nice camping site at the swimming pond.</P>

 <P><B>Sedmihorky  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The hike in the area, quite alright although not as spectacular as the Adr≈°pach-Teplice, so good if you like a few hours hiking.</P>

 <P><B>Vysoka Lipa  <small>(2021-07)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A tiny place with a campsite, and the ending of our version of the Malerweg hike.</P>
