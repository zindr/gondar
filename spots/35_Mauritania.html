	<P><B>Nouakchott <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Brilliant, this run down and dirty capital was just a joke. Be there for being there. There is a market and food around, definetly OK for a day or two... enough to soak in a bit of the surreal. This is not Mauritania, this is Nouakchott...</P>
	
	<P><B>Nouadibou <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A sandy run down city that looks like nothing more than upmarket slums. The big harbour nearby adds to the third world feel. Here you take the free ore wagon to Choum if you like, I have been told it is bad. It is an interesting 17 hour ride up there, on your way to Atar.</P>
	
	<P><B>Atar <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A sandy sandy town with seemingly nothing, except friendly and/or weird people. But hell, there is sand everywhere in this god forsaken place. </P>
	
	<P><B>Cinguetti <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The most easy one to reach of the desert towns, and a place to rent a camel for a six day trip in between there and Ouadane, if you are into that. It is quite touristy, with overly priced food and greedy atmosphere.</P>
