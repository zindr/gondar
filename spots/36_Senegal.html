<P><B>St. Louis  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>French colonialist atmosphere, it was surely nice to hang out for a day. It is big enough to get entertained for those interested while still not too much of a city.</P>

 <P><B>Touba  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>My experience in Touba is a bit atypical because of Tabaski I was invited to stay with a family, one man and two woman. The city is nice at first sight, but most of the time I spent in peoples houses, so I did not see that much of it.</P>

 <P><B>Kaolack  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is not a place you want to go to, but you may well pass it a few times when around. You might see only its dirty, chaotic and polluted bus station.</P>

 <P><B>Tambacounda  <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>On route to Mali, a brief stop... the road up there was beautiful, but difficult. African travel you know.</P>

 <P><B>Dakar  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Missed it last time in Senegal, this is a true African city on the waterfront. Expensive Almadie differs from downtown plateau, slightly more organized Colobane and suburbs like Keur Massar.</P>

 <P><B>Toubakouta  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Take a boat trip in the mangroves and have a relaxing walk near time when around here.</P>

 <P><B>Popenguine  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Known for pilgrimage, it was a good place to cut our trip north to Dakar and sit our ass in the sea.</P>

 <P><B>Ziguinchor  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nice capital city of the southern Casamance, I should maybe have spent a bit more time there.</P>

 <P><B>Oussouye  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Tiny regional city which serves as a good base to reach nearby areas.</P>

 <P><B>Cap Skirring  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Known for its beaches, a place for tourists with many more amenities then most nearby cities.</P>

 <P><B>Diembereng  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Small and scenic little village, fun to walk through and get to the beach.</P>

 <P><B>Kachiouane  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Tiny village that is now attracting many more tourists, I loved the walk all the way up there.</P>

 <P><B>Saly  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The camping place in between Saly and Mbour gave easy access to both, Saly itself is for tourists not like me.</P>

 <P><B>Lac Rose  <small>(2018-11)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Sometimes it is pink, depends on the light, not when I was there, luckily the walk up to the beach was nice and they were playing some techno there.</P>
