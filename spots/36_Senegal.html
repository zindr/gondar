	<P><B>St. Louis <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>French colonialist atmosphere, it was surely nice to hang out for a day. It is big enough to get entertained for those interested while still not too much of a city.</P>
	
	<P><B>Touba <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>My experience in Touba is a bit atypical because of Tabaski I was invited to stay with a family, one man and two woman. The city is nice at first sight, but most of the time I spent in peoples houses, so I did not see that much of it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tambacounda <small>(2007-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>On route to Mali, a brief stop... the road up there was beautiful, but difficult. African travel you know.</P>
