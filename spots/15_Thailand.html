	<P><B>Bangkok <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Big and polluted, with temples and elephants, huge markets and Thai boxing, Kao San Road and traffic madness. It is an interesting place.</P>
	
	<P><B>Sukothai <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Ruins of the oldest Thai city, within a pleasant setting. It is a bit similar to Ayuthaya.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chiang Mai <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The tourist hub, the cultural and economical center in the north. It offers some trekking and cultural trips. For me the market was the main attraction, specially good for Thai silk.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mae Hong Son <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The touristy long neck Karen people can be visited, nearby, and there is some possibility for jungle trips. The town itself is quite insignificant.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chiang Rai <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Kind of an ugly city, but it offers some possibilities for trekking in a nice jungle to see some of the minority people living there. The market is OK, but not like the one in Chiang Mai.</P>
	
	<P><B>Chiang Saen <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>There are a few ruins with historical significance, but not much else. It is mainly the last stop before the golden triangle.</P>
	
	<P><B>Golden Triangle <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The golden triangle where the three countries meet: Burma-Thai-Lao. Unfortunately there is a lot of tourism to spoil most of the fascination brought to you by this area.</P>
