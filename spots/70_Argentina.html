	<P><B>Buenos Aires <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Refreshing... elegance and refinement in the Americas, you do not find that much around. Diversity in food, plenty of places to hang out, interesting suburbs, ... very nice place.</P>
	
	<P><B>Iguazu Falls <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Hugh waterfalls, second widest in the world, in a nice albeit somewhat gamepark like setting. It was spectacular.</P>
	
	<P><B>Puerto Iguazu <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Gateway to the second widest falls in the world, at the time an expensive city that was well equipped for dealing with the flow of tourists.</P>
	
	<P><B>Corrientes <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>In transit... just a walk through.</P>
	
	<P><B>Resistencia <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Hitch-hiking is not easy here... if you are a man... very different for women in this macho culture. A simple transit...</P>
	
	<P><B>Mercedes <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>On my way to Ibera national park, this town was not too bad.</P>
	
	<P><B>Pellegrini <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>An extremely boring looking small tourist town, in the middle of the Ibera wetlands, way to expensive for what it is...</P>
	
	<P><B>El Calafate <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Tourist hub for the glacier Perito Moreno, expensive and set up for tourists.</P>
	
	<P><B>Perito Moreno Glacier <small>(2011-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The biggest glacier, moving and making a lot of noise... impressive. Some go walk on top of it, expensive and not worth it for most. There are touristy boat trips as well, not recommended.</P>
	
	<P><B>El Chalten <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The base for hiking Fitz Roy and surroundings, the town is simple and expensive, set up for tourists because there is nothing else.</P>
	
	<P><B>Laguna Torre <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>For hiking, it is a beautiful spot, and it takes a few days to enjoy.</P>
	
	<P><B>Fitz Roy Hike <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>For hiking, it is a beautiful spot, all over.</P>
	
	<P><B>Piedra Buena <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Cities are boring here in Argentina, and some are really boring.</P>

	<P>Border towns, just passing through.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mendoza <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>In transit, just walking through, I do not think I have missed much here.</P>

	<P><B>Angastaco <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A very small town on the road in the Quebradas, surrounded by brilliant scenery.</P>
	
	<P><B>Molinos <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A small town on the road in the Quebradas, brilliant scenery around it. </P>
	
	<P><B>Cachi <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The recommended tourist spot... a tiny little town, it was nice but it takes only 5 minutes to cross it.</P>
	
	<P><B>Quebrada Tres Cruces - Amphitheatro <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A few rock formations... yeah well, it is a beautiful place to travel through.</P>

	<P><B>La Caldera <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>In transit... to the north, hitchhiking. The scenery is already nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hike / Hitchike north of Salta <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Going north I walked a lot, the scenery was nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Purmamarca <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Nice rocks in this tiny village, very popular with local youngsters for hanging out.</P>
	
	<P><B>Salta <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The centre city of all the Quebradas, a tourist area. I did not like it that much, it suffers from being boring like so many other places in the Americas.</P>
	
	<P><B>Maimara <small>(2012-01)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Another little town in the Quebradas, full with local youngsters.</P>
