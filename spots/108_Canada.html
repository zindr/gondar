<P><B>Calgary  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The gateway to the rockies is not so interesting it seems, but it is quite alright to start and end. </P>

 <P><B>Waterton Lakes  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Waterton town has what you need, we drove to the popular Red Rock Canyon and hiked to the Twin.</P>

 <P><B>Fernie  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Going up, you need to take a break somewhere, and here there was some partying, a town not completely tiny like many others. After Fernie, more north, a lot of tourists go to visit the Radium Hot Springs.</P>

 <P><B>Banff  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>text C-level Cirque hike - Ink Pots near Johnston Canyon</P>

 <P><B>Lake Louise  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the two ridiculously popular lakes, and a base for hiking, we did the six glacier meadow hike. Nearby in the Yolo national park we hiked Paget Lookout and crash visited nearby Field</P>

 <P><B>Helen Lake  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe the best hike around is Cirque Peak, a bit up north you can see the glaciars and hike to Wilcox Pass.</P>

 <P><B>Jasper  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>For a tourist town, this one is surprisingly nice, loved it, and you can visit the nearby Sulphur Hotspring.</P>

 <P><B>Skyline  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Maybe the main hike in miles around, the Skyline, but unfortunately we had to return halfway because it was just a bit too early with all the snow.</P>

 <P><B>Canmore  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Rich people's town Canmore offered a convenient stop, and good for a beer and some poutine.</P>

 <P><B>Innisfail  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Outside the tourist trail, Innisfail made again clear that although nice, canadian towns just like those from the US are pretty boring.</P>

 <P><B>Drumheller  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>One of the few tourist highlightes in the eastern vicinity of Calgary, skelets and bones, dinosaur country, with hoodoo's, pillars in the sand.</P>

 <P><B>Qu√©bec City  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nice little city, European styled and definitely good for a beer or some poutine.</P>

 <P><B>Montreal  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nice city, European styled and interesting to walk around.</P>

 <P><B>Fundy NP  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The main national park in this region, boasting fine coastal areas, mainly.</P>

 <P><B>Kouchibouguac NP  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A national park, alright, but not very interesting although the beach is interesting.</P>

 <P><B>St. Andrews  <small>(2022-06)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Tourist hub near the border, a fun stopover.</P>
