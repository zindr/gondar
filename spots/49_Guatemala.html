<P><B>Guate  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The capital is avoided by most tourist, which I think is a pity. There is not much to keep you busy but it is an interesting place, with a lot of diversity. There are a lot of dodgy areas though. I loved Pension Meza, it is a bit rough with mostly central American tourists, ahem.</P>

 <P><B>Panajachel  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A bit of passed glory, this tourist hangout still has its share of hippies lingering around. Although offering cheap food I left the place almost immediately.</P>

 <P><B>San Pedro La Laguna  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The hippest place at Lake Atitlan today, with a street at the water which caters for your every tourist need. You can do some volcano hiking around here. Fortunately, a bit behind the tourist street real life emerges.</P>

 <P><B>Antigua  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The main tourist draw in the country I think is just boring crap. The side-trip to the Pacaya volcano boasting lava I enjoyed a lot despite being surrounded by hundreds of other tourists.</P>

 <P><B>Xela  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>My entry to Guatemala also was the place to learn some Spanish. Most tourists you meet are here for the same reason, few other things to do.</P>

 <P><B>Chichicastenango  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A crappy tourist show, this city. You get treated accordingly. The Saturday market was super boring, just a market with much tourist crap added to it.</P>

 <P><B>Santa Cruz de Quiche  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just a city and refreshing after Chichis tourist crap. Unfortunately, Quiche you can visit in a few hours.</P>

 <P><B>Nebaj  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The town up in the hills is small and not of particular interest. The nearby waterfalls are a joke. There are some uninspiring hiking opportunities.</P>

 <P><B>Coban  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A fairly dull city where you can do some side-trips. The side-trips to Lanquin and Semuc Siampey can more economically be done from Lanquin.</P>

 <P><B>Lanquin  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Lanquin is a crappy tourist town, dominated by the one hostel. Near town you can visit some insignificant caves that show a large group of bats leaving at dusk (go there about 5, visit the cave and wait at the entrance).</P>

 <P><B>Semuc Champey  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>About 10 kilometers from Lanquin is Semuc Siampey, a beautiful natural spot with waterfalls and a taste of jungle. Both the caves as well as Semuc Siampey can be visited independently in one day when leaving early.</P>

 <P><B>Poptun  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Interesting in its boringness, this place may be your obligatory stop in between Lanquin and Flores. The eastern road from Lanquin is amazing for the first four hours.</P>

 <P><B>El Remate  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another tourist town, El Remate is more like a street with nothing to do but serve as the last stop before the Tikal ruins.</P>

 <P><B>Flores  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Flores is the tourist city that serves for Tikal. Flores is a little peninsula for tourists and Santa Elena is the real city.</P>

 <P><B>Tikal  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>These Maya ruins are appreciated most by the majority of tourists, likely because they are embedded within jungle. A visit typically lasts about 5 hours. The most spectacular is the main square and sitting on top of the highest pyramid overlooking the jungle.</P>

 <P><B>Rio Dulce  <small>(2010-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A tiny little castle on the way to Livingston. The trip by boat is kinda expensive but scenic, most of it can now be done by bus though.</P>

 <P><B>Livingston  <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
<P>That is the Caribian link... Here you see the Garifunas, black people that speak English and show a true Caribbean style. The difference with the rest of the country is the only reason to go there, with no real side trips to make... but if you want to smoke weed and sit on your ass for a week then this may be your taste.</P>

 <P><B>Monterrico  <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A boat trip through the mangroves brings you to a relaxed beach at the pacific. Maybe only never go there during the holy weak, it will be packed with tourists and expensive.</P>
