	<P><B>Hanoi <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>To see Hanoi waking up was mind blowing. At the time cars were not yet omnipresent with bicycles everywhere and the atmosphere was special. My favorite capital in South East Asia. </P>
	
	<P><B>Sapa <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Superb views on mountains and surrounding valleys, tribal villages , these make it the most recommended place of Vietnam. Avoid Thursday to Sunday when the tours go in.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cat Ba Islands <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The islands near Halong Bay do not offer the nicest towns but the landscape is extraordinary. You can sleep on a boat and do the 12 km jungle hike on the main island. </P>
	
	<P><B>Downhill Hike <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Instead of paying a tourist price I just walked down, quite interesting with various hill tribes people and villages on my way.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hue <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Historical city, where you can visit the Tomb of Tu Duc and others and pagodas or whatever. I did not visit the purple city. The new city was OK too. And an interesting day out is the DMZ tour which brings you back to the Vietnam War showing Hamburger Hill, Khe San, the Ho Chi Mihn trail and some other sites including tunnels.</P>
	
	<P><B>Dalat <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The town itself is insignificant, mostly tourists enjoy a guided motto ride through the highlands. Also rock climbing appears to be popular.</P>
	
	<P><B>Hoi An <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This nice little feel-good town is known for its inexpensive tailor made clothes (not very well cut I might add) and its limited influence of modern times. You can also go for a swim in the ocean on a fairly OK sandy beach with moderate waves.</P>
	
	<P><B>Nha Trang <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The city of pick-pockets and beach bums I would have skipped if possible. It is a good place for all you party animals that just love spending money on beer and weed.</P>
	
	<P><B>Saigon <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Millions of motorbikes, at the time, in this dirty but modern western flavoured city. The War Remnants Museum is one of the few must have seen museums in Asia. Based in Saigon you can visit the tunnels of Cu Chi, fighting tunnels during the Vietnam War.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mekong Delta <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Cruising down the Delta in little boats, watching the daily life on the floating markets, visiting the swamps used by the Vietcong in the Rung Tram forest, climbing Sam mountain for sunset with views over the border with Cambodia, ... and finally crossing the border into Cambodia. It was really good.</P>
	
	<P><B>Cau Dai <small>(2001-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The temples of Cau Dai, a last activity before crossing the border into Cambodia, with its peculiar and colorful ceremonies.</P>
