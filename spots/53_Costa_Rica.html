	<P><B>San Jose <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Looking modern at the main street but much rougher a bit further. It is again another slightly dodgy but interesting place in where there is not much to do.</P>
	
	<P><B>Monteverde <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A tourist heaven; hike superb cloud forest, slide the zip-line through jungle, do a night safari to spot tarantulas. Join the drunk 20 year old tourist in the afternoon on the street... crap.</P>
	
	<P><B>Upala <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>If you want to see what a real city without tourists would be like, this may do it... very friendly and boring.</P>
	
	<P><B>Puerto Chimenez <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This little town is nothing but a gateway to the nearby national park: Corcovado.</P>
	
	<P><B>Corcovado National Park <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The park is brilliant, you can do trips of 2 days or more to go from Carate to Sirena along the beach that touches the jungle and back along a different track right through the jungle. </P>
	
	<P><B>Hike corcovado NP <small>(2010-03)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A very nice 2 day hike in and out of the jungle.</P>
	
	<P><B>Tilaran <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The small town is not a place to get stuck, but I was lucky to be invited to stay in someones home.</P>
	
	<P><B>La Fortuna <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A tourist hub because of many tourist attractions. The Arenal volcano was in the clouds though and for me it was just a boring place I was happy to leave. </P>
	
	<P><B>Cahuita <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Boasting a nice piece of jungle at the beach, this relaxed place does attract quite a few tourists. It was a nice place to hang out for a day.</P>
	
	<P><B>Puerto Viejo <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Tourists hanging around on and near the beach, a boring place in many ways but popular nevertheless. </P>
	
	<P><B>Tortuguero <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Interesting place, a tourist town in the middle of the jungle at the Atlantic. Getting there was already worth it, and because I saw so many animals already I did not bother getting into the actual national park. </P>
	
	<P><B>Manuel Antonio NP <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Beautiful spot with many local tourists on the beach and quite a few animals in the jungle. I was happy to see sloths and that was not the only thing. </P>
