	<P><B>Cairo (Giseh pyramids) <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This bustling city can be well worth exploring a day or two, including a visit to the pyramids in nearby Giseh, the national museum and the souq.</P>
	
	<P><B>Luxor <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Luxor is about temples and tombs. Several of the ruins offer an interesting confrontation with the old world. Both the temples on the eastbank, in Luxor city and Karnak, are not to be missed. And the westbank boasts several attractions, like the tombs in the Valley of Kings and the temple of Hatsepsut.</P>
	
	<P><B>Dahab <small>(2004-09)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Dahab is a divers town and a tourist hang-out. Many come here for diving. So I went snorkelling in the Blue Hole, but the coral is largely dead. A night at a Bedouin camp in the nearby Sinai desert was the next thing to do. Nearby a ferry brings you to Jordan.</P>
	
	<P><B>Aswan <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The town is heavily touristed, the whole city decided to ask double price for everything to tourists, even for water and falafel. Across the water is Elephant Island, which is ok to walk around a bit. Aswan is the final stage on route to Abu Simbel or Sudan.</P>
	
	<P><B>Abu Simbel <small>(2005-12)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The main attraction down south is a temple complex with huge statues. You see the main statues from afar when taking the boat to Sudan.</P>
