<P><B>Lilongwe  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another African capital, you have got to love them... but why, that is not always clear. I went to have a beer, strange experience.</P>

 <P><B>Cape Mc Clear  <small>(2010-12)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A tourist hang out, very very relaxed... not my favorite, but many others would probably disagree. The town is tiny.</P>

 <P><B>Monkey Bay  <small>(2011-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Another tourist hang out, a new years celebration...</P>

 <P><B>Mzuzu  <small>(2011-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just another African city, but real and I kinda like it for hanging out a brief time.</P>

 <P><B>Nkhata Bay  <small>(2011-01)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Where there is water there are tourists... not the best place for me, but there were many others.</P>
