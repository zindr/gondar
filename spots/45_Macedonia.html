	<P><B>Skopje <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>While the center is charming, you are quickly out of the center and the rest is not really interesting. A large number of new ornamental bridges and statutes did change the grandeur of the city somewhat, as I noticed 10 years later.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bitola <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The charming city of Bitola is a perfect day trip, with a nice old part and for strolling the main avenue.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ohrid <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This lake side city is the most popular Macedonian tourist spot and can easily entertain you for a day. It is a world away from nearby Albania.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mavrovo <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This town is mostly a ski resort and offers very little, but it is one of the bases for visiting the Mavrovo national park. We hiked for 7 hours up to Jance.</P>
	
	<P><B>Galichnik <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Small town famous for cheese and an ending point for a hike from Mavrovo.</P>
	
	<P><B>Janche <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Small town with traditional houses at the end of a hike from Mavrovo, near the main road.</P>
	
	<P><B>Debar <small>(2014-06)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Crossing borders</P>
