<P><B>Bandar Seri Bewagan  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Even the tourist information officer in charge suggests that there is not really anything to do here... I think one of the mosques was downright amazing though, the other one was OK too. But the city sleeps.</P>

 <P><B>Bangsar  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A tiny regional capital, worth a visit by boat only for visiting a nearby hill with cloud forest. This was indicated as alternative to the crazy expensive national park.</P>

 <P><B>Bukit Patoi  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A hill hike, some cloud forest, an OK view and a centipede. Well, just to do something, why not.</P>

 <P><B>Kuala Belait  <small>(2013-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A proof that also the rest of Brunei is completely boring, just here for starting my hitch-hiking out of the country.</P>
