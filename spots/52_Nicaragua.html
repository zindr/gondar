	<P><B>Managua <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Managua for me was again a brilliant show of the tension between rich and poor, I loved it for the few days I was there but I am sure not many others would. It is one of the few places that sometimes gets to be a little bit surreal.</P>
	
	<P><B>Esteli <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nice city all in all, without being special in any way. It was nice to be back in Nicaragua.</P>
	
	<P><B>Leon <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A nice colonial city most tourists would enjoy. It has an amazing museum, do not miss it. A number of side trips are possible, for example surfboarding a vulcano.</P>
	
	<P><B>Masaya <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This is a popular place because of the nearby volcano, and it is alright as a city. </P>
	
	<P><B>Matagalpa <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Cowboy country in the highlands. It has some coffee farms nearby and some hikes are possible, even one in the jungle taking you about 3 hours.</P>
	
	<P><B>Miraflor NP <small>(2017-04)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>There are some very nice stretches in this national park, dotted with tiny villages and houses. It was a good day hike.</P>
	
	<P><B>Granada <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A tourist city which is charming at first site, but quickly getting boring. </P>
	
	<P><B>Laguna De Apoyo <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Just a crater lake in which you can have a swim if that is your thing.</P>
	
	<P><B>Rivas <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The port town towards the Isla de Omoteppe has a nice real feel to it but will not keep you there long.</P>
	
	<P><B>Isla de Omotepe <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This you can not miss, an island made of two merged volcano that you can climb. The island boasts a tranquil live despite the many tourists that visit is.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bleufields <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Caribian style Bleufields does not have much to do (yet) but still is really nice to hang out because everything here is just a bit different. To get around boats are typically used.</P>
	
	<P><B>Laguna Las Perlas <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A smaller place is the Laguna Las Perlas where you can enjoy visiting the canals and small islands and swimming. Nothing much here to keep you around though.</P>
	
	<P><B>San Carlos <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>For a port border town this one is fairly normal and OK, but still most people would leave the day after.</P>
	
	<P><B>El Castillo de La Concepcion <small>(2010-02)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>The boat trip through the jungle to get there is more than half the fun. The castle is worth a visit, while the town probably is not. Nearby towns may be nicer.</P>
