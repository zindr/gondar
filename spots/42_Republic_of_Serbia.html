	<P><B>Belgrade <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>It is maybe a party city, a bit rough and dull looking at first but stuff happens. Maybe you can catch a 2 Euro ballet performance.</P>
	
	<P><B>Novi Sad <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>This student city has a superb main square and a fort that is OK to visit to keep you busy for a few hours.</P>
	
	<P><B>Subotica <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A charming city, when I was there filled with flowers. The tourist information office was really nice.</P>
	
	<P><B>Nis <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Nice for its people and the tourist information office, but lacking tourist attractions. The skull tower and concentration camp were both a bit dissappointing.</P>
