<P><B>Belgrade  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>It is maybe a party city, a bit rough and dull looking at first but stuff happens. Maybe you can catch a 2 Euro ballet performance. Otherwise, I may be a bit to much passed my years of partying for this city.</P>

 <P><B>Novi Sad  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>This student city has a superb main square and a fort that is OK to visit to keep you busy for a few hours. Actually, the second visit,10 years later, it was a fun night out, including a local festival and many bars.</P>

 <P><B>Subotica  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A charming city, when I was there filled with flowers. The tourist information office was really nice.</P>

 <P><B>Nis  <small>(2008-10)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Nice for its people and the tourist information office, but lacking tourist attractions. The skull tower and concentration camp were both a bit disappointing.</P>

 <P><B>Golubac  <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The impressive route along the Danube starts not far from the little fortress here.</P>

 <P><B>Negotin  <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A lucky stopover for the night in this small but nice town, good for a drink and a nice room.</P>

 <P><B>Studenica Monastary  <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A road trip includes long drives, passing by the monastery, ok if it is your thing. </P>

 <P><B>Novi Pazar  <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>We should have stayed a bit longer in this quirky city, it appears interesting enough to hang around for a day. </P>

 <P><B>Nova Varos  <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Or we should have stayed a bit longer in this tourist city, with its lake nearby. </P>

 <P><B>Uvac Meanders  <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>With a detour we finaly reached the meanders, a perfect reason to stretch the legs.</P>

 <P><B>Ivanjica  <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Road trips bring you to places you would not normally visit, althoug only briefly. It was fun.</P>

 <P><B>Lazarevac  <small>(2018-08)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Road trips bring you to places you would not normally visit, althoug only a night. It was fun.</P>
