<P><B>Tbilisi  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The city is quite OK, a few things to do or hang out.</P>

 <P><B>Batumi  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>A bit weird, as if they prepare for the Olympics, so may new expensive empty buildings in the middle of the rumble of the old city. Some interesting art pieces as well, ready for the rich Russians maybe.</P>

 <P><B>Borjomi  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Charming town, gateway to the Vardzia region but quite OK in itself with nearby forests for walking.</P>

 <P><B>Vardzia (monastery)  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The David Gareja Monastery is one of the most important tourist sites in the country.</P>

 <P><B>Mestia  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The city in the Svaneti region with its peculiar towers. It should offer some hiking possibilities but the one we ended up was not so interesting.</P>

 <P><B>Tsminda Sameba  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The region offers some nice hiking possibilities, I loved it up here in the mountains.</P>

 <P><B>Daryali Gorge  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Near the Russia border it was a good place for a small walk, nice scenery.</P>

 <P><B>Kazbegi (Stephansminda)  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>The main town in Kazbegi region is not so interesting, and remember to get your food at your guest house because there are no good alternatives.</P>

 <P><B>Russia Border  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Just to get to the Russian border, we hitch-hiked through this nice mountainous area.</P>

 <P><B>Mtskheta  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Ancient town that is quite charming and has some interesting buildings, an OK side trip from the capital.</P>

 <P><B>Sighnaghi  <small>(2012-05)</small>:</P></B>
<P>Here the hostel was the main asset, but to get a glimpse of this wine region you may want to get here anyway.</P>
