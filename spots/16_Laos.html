	<P><B>Vientianne <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Not the most beautiful capital around, but I am sure there is a charm to it. </P>
	
	<P><B>Luang Prabang <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>As a very pleasant colonial town that offers very great food from all over the world. There should even be some great trekking there. The small waterfalls nearby are maybe worth the visit too.</P>
	
	<P><B>Vang Vieng <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>At the time this was the place for lazying about, fill your day swimming in the river, going out to visit some cave or just lying in a tube floating on the river while you see the enchanting scenery drift by. It is the tourist hub from Laos.</P>
	
	<P><B>Mong Noi <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Charming on the river banks with family run guest houses,  only nice for its relaxing atmosphere. Mong Noi is an hour upriver from Nong Khiaw, after 10 there is no electricity.</P>
	
	<P><B>Luang Nam Tha <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Here there are some possibilities for trekking, with jungle and tribal groups. The town itself is insignificant.</P>
	
	<P><B>Muang Sing <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Little sleepy town with locals pushing rubbish and drugs, and using various scams. But it should offer some jungle treks by now. </P>
	
	<P><B>Huay Xai <small>(2001-10)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>Ugly border-town, avoid a stay here and pass through it in early morning.</P>
	
	<P><B>Bolaven <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>I would not visit this, especially lacking places to stay. It is a bit different, showing some cotton fields. </P>
	
	<P><B>Si Pan Don <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>4000 islands is same same but different to Mong Noi, with the Mekong going wide dotted with little and very little islands. A very relaxing atmosphere, with extremely quite evenings in family run guest houses.</P>
	
	<P><B>Ban Nape <small>(2001-11)</small>:</P></B>
	<P>A forced stop in a tourist free and boring border town, on my way to Cao Treo in Vietnam. </P>
