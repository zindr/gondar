			<p align='left'>Minimalist of generation X, looking for a place to come home to for about 4 to 5 times each week, in Brussels, short or long term, starting July (approx.).<br>
			Experienced in sharing houses for 4+7+6+3 years; more recently short term in Molenbeek, Anderlecht, Vorst, & Sint-Joost-ten-Node following my new job at the VUB in Jette.<br>

			Price is more important than luxury. Preferably with some furniture, but not necessary.<br>
			Additionally, only living room and bath room are essential.<br>
